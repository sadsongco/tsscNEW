I have an English paranoia about being seen to complain, or about troubling anyone else (\"a friend troubled is a problem doubled\", as someone once said to me). But I don\'t think that it\'s healthy. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m certainly not an advocate of over-sharing. But I find myself bottled up, having long conversations with myself, or arguing with other people in my head, imagining their replies (and their replies are always oh-so-easy to demolish in those scenarios). Probably the first sign of madness.<!--{b::1::R}-->\n\nSo I\'m going to try and go out of my comfort zone and talk about things here. Since everyone else is already. I always like to be last to the party, although I\'m often also first to leave. I can see the attraction. Blogging is a weird thing. It\'s public, but it also seems to be a private endeavour. The internet is public by proxy, rather than the harder, realer publicity of telling your friends face to face what you\'re worrying about.\n\nDon\'t worry though, it\'s not going to be all navel-gazing misery. At least I hope not. I\'m just going to try and say \"out loud\" here what pings around inside my head, thoughts as perpetual motion machine. I\'m going to add a comments section down below as well, because I\'m peculiarly fond of coding, because I want to know when I\'m wrong, when I\'m right, to hear suggestions and directions and pillorying.\n\nAnd soon I will write a blog that isn\'t just about writing a blog.',1),(6,'We started a tour in Northampton, MA on 2nd March and, being as it was not far from his hometown of Springfield, I had the pleasure of hanging out with my friend Mark Mulcahy. His name is not familiar to many, but anyone out there who knows him or his work will probably feel that same thrill that the mention of his name and the subsequent collateral memories and emotions can conjure. He\'s a singer / songwriter, but such an overused and common term sullies his talent. His band Miracle Legion were contemporaries of REM and shared some of their jangly DNA; later on his work became familiar to a certain type of US youth through Polaris and their music for the TV show The Adventures of Pete and Pete.<!--{b::1::R}-->But it was his solo albums that I got to know. I am a staunchly non-religious person, but the only thing that someone could hold up to me and say \"surely there\'s a divine hand in this\" and not have me laugh in their face is Mark\'s singing voice. Effortless climbing beauty, almost indescribable; possessing almost unbearable gravity but simultaneously utterly weightless. When I saw him perform for the first time in five years recently I was in tears within 20 seconds of him opening his mouth. It\'s that good.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I digress slightly, although me waxing rhapsodic about his supreme talent does provide a little context. We were chatting about the tour schedule I keep, both historical and upcoming, and he said he was half jealous of me. And I knew precisely what he meant, because I am half jealous of him, not because of the situation he has found himself in but the strength of his personality.\r\n\r\nA few years ago he lost his wife suddenly, leaving him to care for their young twins, which he now does energetically and admirably. I have children. I don\'t tend to discuss it with fans for the most part because I wish to firewall certain parts of my private life. But it is relevant here, because not a day goes by without my feeing torn between my life, my selfish life of performance and travelling and setting up and tearing down, and my responsibilities as a father. I wish I had the power of will, the generosity of spirit, to stop what I\'m doing and be around for them, even though I know they wouldn\'t ask me, it wouldn\'t even necessarily be the best thing for them. But being separated from them for so much of every year is a constant epicentre of sadness.\r\n<!--{b::2::L}-->\r\nAnd I love and admire and respect Mark for his utter devotion to his family. He did what he had to do. He is a real man. And yes, I\'m half jealous that I can\'t grow up and let my ambition drift away and properly fulfil my calling as a parent.\r\n\r\nBut that\'s not the only powerful connotation I have with Mark\'s presence. Apart from just loving being around him (he is calming, funny, beautific, cheeky, and I\'m informed by many female friends about the sexiest man in the world despite not having the classic good George Clooney / Brad Pitt looks), he is my touchstone for what is important about music. You can never judge it\'s worth by the commercial heft. Leave art to the free market and it homogenises and degrades to a lowest common denominator, with no room for the gorgeous soul of people like Mark Mulcahy, who refuse to do what they think is wrong. He sells next to nothing, criminally. You\'ve never heard of him. But he has one of the greatest voices bestowed upon man; a sense of fingertip-light melody that causes agonised envy amongst musical contemporaries scratching round to try and craft diamants while rubys spill endlessly and effortlessly from the pockets of Mark\'s shabby coat; and a through line of identity, a pure vision with no apparent pretension or tainting ambition.\r\n<!--{b::3::R}-->\r\nI don\'t have a conclusion here. His music is beautiful. Go and listen to it, and for god\'s sake if you ever have the chance go and see him live. And remember that there are big musical artists that suck and tiny obscure artists who are godlike. The converse is just as true, and every possible shade in between. So boring and tiring, hipsters who can\'t like anything when too many people have heard of it, or pop \'fans\' who remain only aware of the commercially successful surface of the vast ocean of music, untroubled by knowledge of the existence of sharks and angel fish and sea horses and rays. Music is never defined by it\'s sales figures.',6),(7,'So, the thing is, when I was on tour a couple of years back I wrote a \'book\'. It\'s definitely a \'book\' and not a book though. It\'s an autobiography with the initial intention of a certain angle on the subject, although as it went along the focus drifted a bit. Really I suppose it was an exorcism after a fashion, trying to word-process some of the pain and anxiety out of my heart.\r\n\r\nAnd it became rapidly unpublishable due to revealing of things that can never be revealed, both personal things and business things and things that are not mine to tell. But, inspired by the stirling work of the CIA in making sure people can\'t trust their government through paranoid lack of transparency, it occurred to me that with this new exciting blog thing happening I could put it out chapter by chapter in a redacted version. Of course it won\'t be like the CIA\'s redacted stuff with those tantalising looking black lines everywhere. It will be invisible re-writing to protect the innocent, so no-one would know what had been hidden and what was the unexpurgated.\r\n\r\nI\'m going to test the waters by posting the introduction to the book in a couple of days and see how that feels. I can\'t be absolutely sure I\'ll go through with any more of it, but the only way to know how I\'ll feel is to give it a go, yes? If you want to keep up with the chapters if / when they come I\'ve added an RSS feed - look down the bottom of the page. And comment down below, let me know what y\'all think of the idea.',7),(8,'<strong>Introduction</strong>\n\n<i>October 12th 2010, Albuquerque, NM, USA</i>\n\nI\'m 39 and 11 days old, which is clearly much too old to be any kind of musician on the road with a rock band. I\'m playing with English musician Frank Turner as a member of his backing band. The distinction is necessary, since things are different to being a member of a band, which is somewhere near the crux of this little piece of writing. Even if it is an illusion (which it almost always is), every member of a band has their say, tied to their stake in the success or failure of the group as a whole, although, as we shall see later, even-handed democracy is never a true option. For a backing band though there is no grey area. Whoever you\'re playing for is the boss, the big numero uno, El Jefe, head honcho; and whatever they say goes.\n\nSuch is the way it has been since early 2007, when I first started playing with Frank<!--{f::1::n}-->, and now. So why has it particularly exercised me tonight? Let\'s rewind a couple of days and contextualize a little shall we?\n\nWe flew in to Austin, Texas to begin our tour a few days ago, on 9th October. By Frank\'s standards it was not actually too bad a journey. Frank controls his own finances and co-manages himself with the verve of the true control freak, and consequently scours the internet for the very very cheapest flights for when we come out to the states. This is actually the first time we have come out at the same time as him (before this he has already been in the country playing solo shows or doing press prior to our arrival), so the unkind could suggest that this is the reason that our flight leaves Heathrow at a very reasonable 1.20 p.m. rather than the usual 7.30 a.m., but I\'m confident that this is not true. To give the man his dues, if there is &pound;4.50 to be saved on something he\'s quite happy to put himself through some kind of stupid inconvenience right along with everyone else.\n\nHowever, despite the friendly departure hour it hasn\'t been the most relaxing of flights - we spent 3 hours and 10 minutes on the tarmac at Heathrow while engineers apparently expended their efforts fixing an unspecified fault on the plane before finally leaving; we had pilots who plotted a course through apparently every piece of unpleasant turbulence in the sky; and, when we finally arrived at our connection hub of Atlanta, we were prevented from leaving the plane for a further perspiratory 15 minutes by a faulty jetway, meaning there was a scrum of nervous people whose onwards flights, instead of being the humdrum wait that they had anticipated, had now become a desperate run and pray.\n\nWe made our connection, however, arriving in Austin just after 11 p.m. at night to meet tour manager Casey and be taken to our bus for the tour. As will later clearly become a theme, I\'m first into my bunk on the bus. Bass player Tarrant, guitarist Ben and keyboardist Matt have a quick trip to a nearby 24 hour store and then follow. Frank, however, goes out and stays out, finally showing up at the festival the following day to perform an effective but somewhat tired show. Not a particular problem - everyone is pretty jet lagged. Conversationally later I ask Frank about his previous evening\'s activities, and he claims a quiet one, but Frank has a large sliding scale of this kind of thing - sometimes a quiet one means two beers and a night of convivial company, other times it means that he chose not to inject stuff into his eyeballs when everyone else was. After we perform Frank heads into town to drink with friends Fake Problems. \n\nDue to the festival headline band and local laws, despite being done playing by 2 p.m. we leave the festival at close to midnight, being driven through the night by Craig up front while we all sleep in our tomb-like bunks in the back. Frank, to give him his due once more, returned early from the Fake Problems / Rival Schools show and is tucked up well before we leave. After a long and boring journey we arrive in Albuquerque about 8 p.m. The bus door has a busted lock so someone has to stay on board - I run out and get a sandwich and return so everyone else can head out for food and frolics. I\'m in bed first.\n\nJet lag always seems to affect me more on the second day, so I\'m waking up every few hours. Frank is in the bunk below me, except he isn\'t at midnight, or 2.30 a.m., or 5.30 a.m., or 7 a.m. He is there when I get up at 8 though. Jolly good.\n\nSo finally we finish rewinding and get to the fucking point, eh? We play our show in Low Spirits, a bar on the edge of a part of Albuquerque that locals tell me is called the war zone. Which is the kind of place gigs always are. It\'s not packed by any means, but the crowd makes up for numbers with enthusiasm, a couple of them having made the 3 1/2 hour journey from El Paso in Texas. Frank, as he often does, has been keeping an eye on his merch<!--{f::2::n}--> throughout the evening, but this particular night this has involved sitting at the bar being bought a steady stream of drinks by well-wishers, who have clearly taken his songs of wistful hedonism to heart and want to be enablers any way they can.\n\nWe hit the stage and the two nights of minimal sleep combine with the evening\'s indulgence to produce a desperately sub-standard show. Bloodshot Frank rambles, from time to time almost incontinently, between songs; he fails to notice his guitar constantly drifting out of tune and I have to nudge him to check it; and worst of all halfway through his voice, battle hardened as it is through the most intense gigging schedule that anyone has undertaken over the last few years, gives up. The dramatic high note in Long Live The Queen is the trigger - it comes out as a squeaky rasp that doesn\'t even share DNA with the correct pitch, and in the manner of a buzz bomb lays waste to all of the notes surrounding it. From then on I can hear the increasing inaccuracy as Frank pushes his voice harder and harder to try and make the end of the show, but the fatigue won\'t allow his usual Henry Rollins / iron man push through to the end.\n\nIs the show bad? Do people not enjoy it? That\'s not the case at all. I\'m happy that, as a professional band, nowadays our worst show is still delivering money-worth to an audience. But it could have been better. Not to put it all at the door of the Turner though; everyone could have done better. But the show is all about him; the audience focusses on him almost to the exclusion of all else (I\'m confident I could come on naked from the waist down and no-one would notice), so his failings have a more marked effect than if I\'m playing slightly off piste.\n\nI\'m reading a musical memoir on the tour<!--{f::3::n}-->. That and the evening\'s events rev the thought engine. I\'ve been on the road with bands in various capacities since I was 18, and I\'ve been a teetotaler since I was 13; this means that throughout my professional life I\'ve felt somewhat like an alien in the permissive world of rock and roll. There\'s no place for anyone to be judgmental out here, so that\'s not my position. But being stymied in my desire to do the best show possible this evening through the actions of the band leader; not having the authority to say anything about it (I\'m a backing musician, I\'m just supporting his career, and if his favoured approach is to sink into high-functioning alcoholism I have no input to that); and the onset of the sense of tour dislocation makes me want to put it down and analyze it. As much as anything it\'s an excuse to tell my own history, and try and make sense of why I feel so comfortable in the business of music, but at the same time so alienated and like a skeleton at a wedding. How does, essentially, a puritan fit in to the encouraged permissiveness of rock and roll? Or, more succinctly, what the fuck am I doing here?\n',8),(9,'This is the original reason that it occurred to me to start blogging. I\'d find myself on the tourbus with my iPod on having memories and thoughts triggered as shuffle offered up various tidbits that I wouldn\'t have put on of my own accord. So I\'m going to give that a go at translating it to blog form, hopefully with some Spotify or other links to listen to what I\'m listening to. I\'ll do my best to avoid it all being \"I like this because...\", although I think that is an inevitability from time to time. And the other important thing is this:\r\n\r\nI\'m aware my music listening has become somewhat atrophied. I think this is somewhat a currency of ageing - I don\'t have the appetite to assimilate new music that I once did, or the time to go looking for it. And also the thrill of discovery has somewhat gone with cynicism; my analytical brain, the bit of me that has got used to making sure I can play what I\'m hearing pretty much straight out in case I get called for a session, looks at the \'how\' and the \'why\' and the structure and arrangement and does drain the untrammelled joy of surprise. \r\n\r\nBut I want you people to make suggestions for me, down there in the comments. It lets me know when there\'s a new comment so I always see them, and given that you\'re going to be discovering what\'s on my iTunes (my aren\'t we plugging evil mulitnational Apple&copy; today) you can recommend some other things that you think I might like. No links allowed down there, but don\'t worry, I\'ll find anything you suggest.\r\n\r\nSurely enough preamble, please lord say that\'s enough. Let\'s begin the shuffle...\r\n\r\n<strong>Wrathchild - Iron Maiden (Killers)</strong>\r\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/wrathchild/id15957071?i=15956929&uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\"><img src = \"media/graphics/itunes.png\" alt = \"buy from iTunes\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = \"spotify:track:0yni4GUDXNDFdHlnOrDWsn\"><img src = \"media/graphics/spotify.png\" alt = \"listen on Spotify\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWow, what a way to start. This speaks to me about school days and wearing all denim. My denim jacket had myriad patches on the back, my hair was shoulder length (the most I could get away with as an eleven year old at school), I even briefly wore cowboy boots. I remember my favourite band, IQ, didn\'t have patches so I got my mum to embroider their logo onto the jacket. She was a saint. That didn\'t last though. My brother bought into the culture even deeper, with leather trousers and studded belts. I love this kind of rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Advice To A Lover - Unbelievable Truth (sorrythankyou)</strong>\r\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/advice-to-a-lover/id200965586?i=200965628&uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\"><img src = \"media/graphics/itunes.png\" alt = \"buy from iTunes\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = \"spotify:track:47JkPydmkUrRYOPCnj3zIJ\"><img src = \"media/graphics/spotify.png\" alt = \"listen on Spotify\" /></a>\r\n\r\nThere is a fair amount of music that I\'ve made on my iTunes. It keeps it together and available. I guess it\'s kind of onanistic, but hey, sue me. This period makes me sad. I produced our second album amidst not inconsiderable bad vibes from our (major) record company, and I fucked it up. Not royally, but the paranoia and low self-esteem took a toll that dripped over the album like tar. But in the long run, I still feel proud. I was in a band with my two best friends in the world and we made good music and had some success and pleased some people. I\'ll put aside my negative feelings and let the positivity flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>The One I Love (live from McCabe\'s guitar shop) - R.E.M.</strong>\r\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/the-one-i-love-live/id14552654?i=14552646&uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\"><img src = \"media/graphics/itunes.png\" alt = \"buy from iTunes\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = \"spotify:track:4jtROdoW3vQs8TYmJqxObq\"><img src = \"media/graphics/spotify.png\" alt = \"listen on Spotify\" /></a>\r\n\r\nScratchy bootleg-quality b-side. I don\'t feel I\'ve ever been constrained by technical requirements. I like to record things well, and I like the sound quality to be the best possible, but I have a deep belief that it\'s a long way from vital. Spirit, a great song, belief, a performance are all so much more important than which microphone you used on the snare, or whether you mix it on an SSL or a Neve. But then again like much of my life it\'s a duality, because I can obsess over mix minutiae and microphone placement as well as anyone. Everything in moderation. If the technical aspects delay performance or vibe, you\'re doing it wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Mirror, Mirror - Dr Dog (Dr Dog)</strong>\r\n\r\nWas given a copy of this record a couple of years ago by, I think, our friend Chris Trovero in LA (he worked for Epitaph at the time, but he\'s much more than that). Haven\'t listened to it that much, but everytime it comes up on shuffle it reminds me that I really should give it more time. I\'m going to stop typing and listen to this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Always By Your Side (demo) - Andy Yorke</strong>\r\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/simple/id283980450?uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\"><img src = \"media/graphics/itunes.png\" alt = \"buy from iTunes\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = \"spotify:album:2yseAjhryIMJAeey8WquCc\"><img src = \"media/graphics/spotify.png\" alt = \"listen on Spotify\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMore stuff that involves me. No comment. Except for noting that Andy is a wonderful human being.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe) - Genesis - Platinum Collection</strong>\r\n<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/i-know-what-i-like-in-your/id137895806?i=137896382&uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\"><img src = \"media/graphics/itunes.png\" alt = \"buy from iTunes\" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href = \"spotify:track:52DNwbdeAKGihHBZbN4phK\"><img src = \"media/graphics/spotify.png\" alt = \"listen on Spotify\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAfter stuff I\'ve done the next biggest subsection on my iTunes (and therefore stuff that will come up statistically more often) is Genesis, or Genesis related stuff. Everyone needs an obsession I guess, and Genesis is mine. Particularly I have loads of live bootlegs, and I guess that\'s a particular aspect of them that informs me and what I do now. They were pretty much always better live than they were on record. It didn\'t make the records bad at all, but there was an extra vitality live that they never caught (maybe on Genesis and Abacab). I feel the same about the albums I\'m making at the moment. They\'re not perfect. They capture how we are now, and then we go out and play it much better live. I\'m proud to be part of the band that I play with at the moment. Seriously.\r\n\r\nI think that will probably do for my first foray into this kind of blog. If anyone is curious I am going to continue posting Puritan (my autobiography, which has been described as \"shorter than a novel, longer than a pamphlet\") but I would like to add relevant photos to it, and certainly for the first few chapters all those pictures of me as a little whippersnapper are stored at home, so until I can get back there and scan some in (April 9th I think we\'re home) it\'s going to be on hold.',9),(10,'<!--{q::1::l}-->I\'m writing this from Shanghai in China, my first visit to this country. I\'m not going to give you my impressions. I\'m not Michael Palin, nor indeed Bill Bryson (although I can recommend all of Mr. Bryson\'s travel books as some of the most amusing writing I\'ve ever had the pleasure of embarrassingly snorting on the bus at), but being in this country has certainly focussed my thoughts on a particular area of life that I try and avoid for the most part. A delicate area.\r\n<!--{b::1::L}-->\r\nFor a long time now I have downplayed my political thinking, for a number of reasons certainly but not least of those is that I have been in professional situations with people whom I know hold very differing views to mine. And for anyone reading this, nodding sagely and thinking they know the ins and outs of what I\'m talking about, you probably don\'t. Certainly not in its entirety, and unequivocally without sufficient context to really have a handle on anything. \r\n\r\nGoodness, did that last bit seem a little defensive? It did? Then maybe I should explain, even though it will mean a red herring before I\'ve even begun blogging about what I was intending.\r\n\r\nSo those sage nodders are probably thinking about an incident involving someone I work with not too many months ago, a storm in a twitter-cup about viewpoints and opinions and personal beliefs. Now, this unnamed person is one of those who I referred to earlier with whom I have a, shall we say, non-chiming point of political view. But FAR more important that that is that he is a friend and a top-notch guy. I can disagree with him because I know him well, I have discussed these things in-depth with him, I understand the nuance and the breadth and depth and quiddity of what he believes. Some internet twat thinking they have the most miniscule iota of a right to slag him off based on slender, distorted and incomplete information makes my blood boil. Believe me that I have almost infinitely more loyalty to friendship than I do to any ideology.\r\n\r\nBut maybe this isn\'t a red herring. If you want to pigeon hole me (feel free), this is where I stand. I believe in meritocracy, but I believe equally as strongly in equality of opportunity. I believe most strongly that every child - EVERY child - should, to the best of society\'s ability, be given the same opportunities and environment that would allow them to suceed, through talent and hard work, or the very idea of a meritocracy is thoroughly bogus.\r\n<!--{b::2::R}-->\r\nIt was not always thus. I used to be much more left leaning, believing in absolute equality between people (yes, communism). My only holdover from this is a vehement belief in the utter failure of the free market to correctly value people. A venal shithead like Donald Trump is worth hundreds of times more to the world than a nurse or primary school teacher<!--{f::1::n}-->? Surely an exact inverse of the the case?\r\n\r\nBut outside of that I now know that my previous ideal of socialist \'fairness\' like that does not exist. The shiftless and the slothful should not be rewarded as highly as the industrious and motivated.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly I\'m going to abandon ship on this blog. It\'s dull. It\'s just my opinion. I like my opinion, and I\'m happy with it, and I base decisions and attitudes on it without doubt or embarrassment. But I don\'t feel the need to convert or espouse or evangelise. I will leave you with the one tenet of my beliefs which I believe is well worth flagging. Always always remember than government is your tool. You are in charge of it, never ever the other way around. If you had a business and were part of, say, a board of directors who together, democratically, chose someone to manage your company. You pay them from the income of the company, money that otherwise could go to you, and you give them a budget to make sure the company is run well. Certainly you give them responsibility and leeway and domain, otherwise they cannot do their job. But always and throughout they remain your employee. If you want to protect your investment you keep an eye on them and make sure they are not running your company into the ground, or doing this with it that don\'t meet your approval.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron is your employee. Claim ownership of your country. They are not in charge. They are merely skilled (sometimes...) caretakers.',10),(11,'So here\'s another in what I anticipate to be a series. Jeez, what a lot of series we have running - Puritan (to be continues when I get access to my old photos and a scanner, so I can make it a bit more visually interesting), Blogging The Shuffle (which will continue when enough time has elapsed since the first one to make it seem FRESH and NEW again), and now this - Genesis.\r\n\r\nMy biggest, and sometimes rationality defying musical... influence? Inspiration? Both of those words seem wrong somehow, because the band, and the related solo careers and extra-curricular work, have taught me plenty of negatives as well as a wealth of positives. But certainly what I do is informed by them, maybe because above any other act out there (that I haven\'t been involved with) I am very informed about them.\r\n\r\nI could write a book about it, but it would be very similar to others that have been written, hopefully without the fawning apologist bullshit that most of their biographers have fallen into. They formed at school, a very posh school, in England in the sixties, and were discovered by school old boy Jonathan King. And right there is the first area where our group of uninterested non-investigative biographers skate over. Let\'s face it, it has come to light that Jonathan King was \"interested\" in young boys, and The Garden Wall and The Anon (the two school bands who amalgamated to become Genesis, Peter Gabriel and Tony Banks in the former, Ant Phillips and Mike Rutherford in the latter, and at this point no-one gives a toss about the drummer) were pouty, clean skinned examples of the public school system... maybe their ambition was partly driven by being chased by demons... memories of the sweaty contorted face of their mentor... who knows. But it doesn\'t seem beyond reason.\r\n<!--{b::1::R}-->\r\nAnyway, they made a debut album (which I must admit I\'ve never sat all the way through) which sank like a commercial snitch with the rock of bollocksness chained to his ankle. Cue Jonathan King exiting the scene (and a possible group sigh of relief from the collected ringpieces), being dropped from their deal, retreating to a cottage in the country for six months and gorging on King Crimson until their songs had fattened up to the point of prog.\r\n\r\nOne vital point of inspiration that they share with everyone on my heroes list is that they toured like madmen. Constantly, even from the start, once they\'d emerged from their progging up time in the cottage. Eventually the touring scored them a deal with an indie (Charisma Records) and they made another album, Trespass, which is good but missing an essential ingredient for me.\r\n\r\nThen founder member Ant Phillips leave, and they realise that maybe having a good drummer might be an advantage. Reorganisation - London grammar school boy Phil Collins is hired as drummer and Steve Hackett completes the line up a short while later. And then things get interesting. So naturally, at that point, to make things bite-sized and easy to digest, I will leave this episode. And tell anyone still listening why I think it\'s interesting later. Bye!',11),(12,'<strong>1971 - 1982: It\'s Cold Outside, But It Gets So Hot In Here</strong>\n\nOh shit. That\'s mum and dad. Keep your head, don\'t giggle, just keep tidying up the bottles and cans into the bin bag in the garage. I think they\'re angry, but I\'m finding it curiously hard to read these people who I\'ve known since I emerged into the world. My brain feels like it\'s got a kettle element in and the whole thing has turned molten and boiling like mud, big bubbles exploding on the surface making it hard to focus and converse and recognise. My big brother Adrian is here as well, and another friend, but I feel like I\'m in one of these mud bubbles possibly floating a few inches off the floor. Hold it together. It\'s the night of my first gig. And it\'s the first time I\'ve been drunk.\n\nI don\'t know about you but in any book like this, this is the chapter that I skim. Surely you know the one - \"I was born to Jill and Michael Sousaphone on January 15th 1967 at Sister Mary\'s Hospital in County Armagh... Jill\'s father, my grandfather, was a bull of a man who had been at Paschendale and would proudly show his neatly stitched row of 8 bullet wounds to anyone who didn\'t find the sight of his buttocks nauseating... Michael was a carpenter by trade, so naturally my go-kart was the best of anyone\'s\". That\'s not going to happen here. I\'m the fucking drummer, not Barack Obama or J K Rowling, so who, frankly, gives a shit about the minutae of my upbringing?\n\nHowever if anyone is going to give the remotest flying twat about this anyway (and if you\'re going to write you have to at least pretend to yourself that someone will), then maybe context is important. If I were to have an editor for this, I would imagine them saying \"stick to the spine of your story\", the spine in this case being \"how and why I became a musician\", \"why don\'t I drink\" and \"what has this meant for my life on the road\". So some bare bones of how it all began is regrettably inevitable.\n\nI was born 1st October 1971. I\'ve noticed that \'professional\' biographers at this point will research interesting facts about the time of their birth (who was Prime Minister, international events of note, who won the big sporting events of the time), but frankly you\'ve got access to google, so fuck off and do it yourself if you actually care. It doesn\'t mean anything to me - like everyone else I don\'t have any active memories for at least 3 years after that, and even then it\'s patchy and terminally irrelevant. In terms of what we\'re talking about there\'s nothing much of note until 1980, when we moved from the terraced house behind Bickley<!--{f::1::n}--> station that I was born into to a larger detached 5 minutes down the road.\n<!--{b::1::L}-->\nBut maybe I\'m being disingenuous. Maybe I should sketch in the background a little more so you can make up your own mind about things, say \"aha, he can\'t see it himself because he\'s too close, but clearly he has issues here\". For those of you who just want the meat, I\'m foreseeing at least two paragraphs you can skate or skip across.\n\nI was always middle class. Even though the first house I remember, at 2 The Pantiles in Bickley, was a tiny terrace with only two bedrooms it was still in a quiet little cul-de-sac, with the peace only somewhat shattered by the presence, just over the fence at the end of the close, of Bickley train station. The tracks themselves were in a deep cut keeping the noise of the passing trains minimal, but for many years afterwards my older brother (and only sibling) Adrian could recite the platform announcements confidently. In fact I\'m sure that to this day if you needed to know the stations that trains would call at going from Bickley up the line to Victoria Station in Central London (the commuter path my dad took daily), or the other direction to St. Mary\'s Cray, he could rattle them off without hesitation. The only musical disappointment connected to the size of the Pantiles house was, as I discovered later, that when my great Aunt died she left my parents her Steinway grand piano, but since it would have taken up the entire ground floor of the house, leaving only about 6 inches around the edge, they had to sell it.\n\nLater it began to seem that my middle classness was by combination rather than birth. Dad came from lower down the caste list - a twin born in Chippenham, Wiltshire to stoutly working class parents - but he dragged himself out of it by dint of his unnatural intelligence. I\'ve no idea if being cleverer than everybody else, both in his school and most likely his town, was a burden - I\'ve found it difficult enough throughout history to get him to enthuse about what he did earlier that afternoon, let alone hear about his childhood. But I do know he exploded out of his small town low aspiration comprehensive, went to medical school and subsequently began collecting PhDs (he\'s up to 4 and a professorship now, if you must know).\n\nAnd at a certain rung he bumped into my mum traveling down the social ladder. She was born into a well-to-do Blackheath family but seemed to be possessed of a determination, that she shared with her two elder sisters and eldest brother, to do things for herself. She trained as a nursery nurse, and met my dad when she was being secretarial around Middlesex University. He employed her to type out his PhD (the first one!), and clearly some shocking shenanigans ensued since they married a mere 9 months after meeting. My brother beat me out of the womb by 3 1/2 years, and I turned out to be something of a surprise after pregnancy complications subsequent to my brother seemed to put paid to the prospect of any further Powells. But yay dad\'s sperm; I made it.\n\nSorry skipping gang, that was 3 paragraphs of exactly what I was taking the piss out of earlier. But for the amateur psychologists our there, here\'s one more childhood story for you to sink your teeth into. For my brother\'s 8th or 9th birthday his party was to go down to the park and play football with his friends. Mum suggested that since she was preparing the meal my dad could take them, and maybe toddling little me could tag along so I didn\'t get under her feet. Good football was played, and sometime later a sweaty team of boys returned all glowing to the house. \"Good game?\" idly enquired my mum. And, \"where\'s Nigel?\". Not being of a sporting bent I had been placed on a swing in the playground while the important manly competition took place. I hadn\'t really noticed when they left, although I do particularly remember the incident - I think it was the first time I\'d seen a sunset, as I sat motionless on the swing, my momentum long since spent. A somewhat flustered dad appeared just as visibility was dropping away to nothing to return an apparently totally unconcerned me to the bosom of the family.\n\nI don\'t particularly remember music being a massive part of family life early on. Bob Dylan got spins on the household turntable, and I know my parents owned many Beatles platters, but they didn\'t penetrate my consciousness at that time. I much preferred \"I Tawt I Taw A Puddy Tat\" <!--{s::1::n}--> by cartoon characters Sylvester and Tweetie Pie, until my brother smashed the record over some childhood tantrum. I do remember being upset by that, and slightly unable to believe that music could actually break. I can also put down the beginnings of a later predilection for prog rock to my parent\'s passion for a French pop instrumental composer called Andr&eacute; Gagnon, whose pieces in retrospect all sound like After The Ordeal by Genesis<!--{f::2::n}--> <!--{s::2::n}--> played at 33 rpm instead of 45. <!--{s::3::n}-->\n\nBut somehow my brother and I caught the bug. Or perhaps my brother caught the bug and I followed him in the way that younger siblings are wont to do, even when said older sibling had abused his position in the shared bedroom of their first house to cause untold suffering (by the application of, for instance, Dutch Ovens). Naturally one of the memoir motives for anyone has to be revenge and redress in print.\n<!--{b::2::R}-->\nI digress. Won\'t be the first time you hear that. By the time we moved to Highfield Road in Bickley in 1980 (I left one house to attend school, and walked back to a different one) Adrian had already been taking classical guitar lessons for some years, and by all accounts excelling - I really enjoyed listening to him practicing John Williams\' Cavatina <!--{s::4::n}--> in the house - while making some forays into electric guitar playing with friends from the church we attended, Central Bromley Methodist. Both of us joined the church folk group, The Bridgebuilders, me just as a cute widdle singer, Adrian adding yet another acoustic guitar to the mix. We had a uniform of blue jeans and a bright red collared shirt, and we played during services at the church, including a special service invented apparently just for us called the Folk Communion. We also managed to get ourselves pimped out to other associated churches around the country - possibly my first experience of touring. My strongest memory of that group is the other cute widdle singer Amanda Whalley vomiting apparently unchewed and undigested spaghetti out of her nose after a rehearsal. The things a 10 year old mind chooses to store. The Bridgebuilders came to an abrupt end when it was apparently discovered that the willowy leader of the group was apparently having an affair with the Reverend of the church, resulting in the overnight disappearance of The Bridgebuilders, the Reverence, and his daughter Claire, on whom I had had a profound and long lasting pre-pubescent crush.\n<!--{b::3::L}-->\nMy listening tastes had moved on to Adam and the Ants, with Antmusic being the first 7\" single I ever bought, followed by the Kings Of The Wild Frontier album<!--{s::5::n}--> not too long after. Many things from childhood you return to in later years and discover that they were, not to put too fine a point on it, shit. I\'m sure I Tawt I Taw A Puddy Tat is not up there with the best of Springsteen. But, along with a generation of other people, having your first pop sensation be Adam Ant, and more particularly that first album for CBS, is no bad thing. I listened to it recently, and not only is it not shit, it\'s actually far far better than I gave it credit for at the time, with Marco Pirroni\'s ear for a killer riff and penchant for unusual key changes making the whole thing the perfect balance between pop and rock.\n\nThis was still idle young dilly dallying with music, though as Adrian\'s interest in music grew I did become more involved. Quite early on we had a hi-fi with a microphone input, and also a second portable tape cassette player. I constructed myself a snare drum from a catering size margarine pot with a hundred or so pieces of cut up wire clattering around in the bottom. I don\'t recall having any special yen to be drummer, although like most kids I was more than happy to hit things with wooden spoons at any and all times, but Adrian needed a drummer, so that was that. Adrian would play guitar and I would wallop the snare as we played a song into the hi-fi (usually something from our Bridgebuilders repertoire but rocked up), and then we\'d take that cassette, put it in the other player and play along, Adrian on a second electric guitar part and me singing. I do remember doing lots of these kind of sound on sound recording experiments, including messing about with speed, and getting a small hint of interest in the process of recording things.\n\nAdrian\'s music taste was also to have a profound effect on my later development. While I was idolising, and occasionally dressing like, Adam Ant, Adrian\'s taste was heading rockwards. Saxon, Rainbow but most importantly Iron Maiden were the diet of the day, and it couldn\'t help but seep in when it was being played at supersonic volume throughout the house. But it was to be my best friend at school who was to plant a seed that would have unfortunate future consequences.\n\nI moved from my primary, Bickley Parva, to my first â€š\'proper\' school, Eltham College in Mottingham. Dad, obviously stricken with terror that Adrian and I would slide back down the greasy class pole that he\'d dragged himself up, was insistent that we would have a private eduction, but finances being what they were the upper echelon was never an option. Eltham, as far as I have an understanding of it, was considered just a hair\'s breadth above a comprehensive - class sizes were smaller, facilities were somewhat better and we HAD A RUGBY TEAM, but it was rough as fuck and not a place for the fey or faint-hearted. I struck up a friendship early on with Darren White, possibly mostly predicated on geographical convenience, since he lived a convenient 5 minute walk from me on a posh street across from the station. His house seemed vast to me and, with a later knowledge of property values, was probably extraordinarily expensive - leafy street in the close commuter belt, at least 6 bedrooms that I remember, with a massive garden containing a succession of greenhouses and outhouses where fun (which at this time mostly involved destroying ketchup-filled Action Men with smuggled french fireworks) could be had.\n\nI spent huge tracts of time around there, mostly playing on Darren\'s Dragon 32 computer, and I didn\'t give a rat\'s arse what his dad did. Who does? He was some heavyset bloke who wore satin jackets and slightly tinted glasses and told us to wipe our feet when we came in. But he was friendly enough, and invited Adrian and me to his work one day. As it turned out he managed the hard rock band Nazareth, and inviting us to work involved going to the final night of their Shapes Of Things tour at Hammersmith Odeon.\n\nI imagine most people\'s first experience of attending a gig is using the ticket your mum bought you to furtively gain entry while underage to your favourite band\'s nearest show, then hanging about at the back feeling nervous until getting up the courage to shove your way forwards to get close when they actually play. Not for me such prosaic experiences, oh no. I was picked up by a stretch limo from my house and whisked to the stage door of the venue, where we were escorted by a satin jacketed flunky to front row seats on the balcony to watch the show, with it\'s high decibels and flash pot 1970sness. Then to backstage, where we drank bucks fizz with the band and they signed copies of the live album that someone had given us. Then a limo back to my front door. My young brain went - gigs, y\'know, they\'re pretty fucking cool.\n\nIt probably wasn\'t long after this that our house on Highfield Road was burgled while we were on holiday in Chippenham. Insurance paid out (my how times have changed), but there was a great number of irreplaceable items amongst what was lost - mum\'s engagement ring, jewelry handed down in the family, that kind of thing. So my ever enterprising brother, who had started a band at Eltham where he was 3 years my senior and was in need of a drummer, convinced the parents to buy me a drumkit. My memory of this was that I was pretty much \"yeah, sure, whatever\" about it and Adrian was the driving force.\n<!--{b::4::R}-->\nSo it came to pass that our house was the recipient of a white Rogers R360 5 piece drum set, and a flimsy book entitled â€š\'Teach Yourself Rock Drums\' which I worked my way through. A couple of the things seemed tricky for a couple of days, but I was confidently holding down beats before too long. We got together in the spare bedroom to rehearse cover versions with friends from church, named ourselves Cassiopea (which I painstakingly spray painted onto a large piece of wood to make a backdrop) and it all seemed like jolly good fun. And then mum and dad, who had clearly no idea about my brother, suggested that they go out of an evening and that Adrian could organise a party for him and his friends. Even without the benefit of myspace, messiness was almost bound to ensue.\n\nAdrian and I worked all day clearing the furniture out of the connected dining room and living room, then setting up the band equipment on the â€š\'stage\' (the dining room) pointing towards the â€š\'audience\' (the living room). We had two drummers, not wanting Sean from church to feel left out, Adrian on guitar, a guy called Nick playing bass and a collection of different singers for different songs. Sean and I also traded places playing keyboards as well.\n\nOnce The Authority headed off for town at 7 o\'clock about 2 billion of Adrian\'s friends, plus Darren White to keep me company, descended on the house. Church group bollocks - this was more like the hordes of mongol. Beer, wine and cider (I don\'t remember spirits being a big thing) started appearing, bought by bigger brothers or lifted from parent\'s stashes, until there was a pile in our garage not unlike the Devil\'s Tower Roy Neary constructs in Close Encounters, except Bulmers and Skol instead of dirt and mashed potato. Even at this earlier and  more impressionable age though I was setting the beginnings of a pattern -  though tempted there was no way I was drinking anything before my first ever gig. I needed to be the best I could be. What a twat.\n\nI had a tape of this show for many years, now sadly disappeared. I don\'t remember the full setlist, but it certainly included 11 O\'clock Tick Tock by U2<!--{s::6::n}--> and He Knows You Know by Marillion <!--{s::7::n}-->. I enjoyed it, but it wasn\'t a Damascus-style life changing experience. Getting drunk afterwards was totally boss<!--{f::3::n}-->, however.\n<!--{b::5::L}-->\nHaving never touched a drop of alcohol, I did as everyone else was doing and launched into the cider with aplomb. I have no idea how much I had, no doubt it was a tiny amount, but it was still plenty to turn my skinny alcohol-virgin body into a semi-solid mass of blubber. Everything looked distinctly different, the rooms heaved this way and that as if I was on a boat and I talked to girls older than me without a hint of embarrassment. Appealing stuff for a 12 year old.\n\nWhen mum and dad returned at midnight I can still recall their almost total shock and lack of comprehension of what faced them. The music in the lounge was loud enough that they probably heard it as their Vauxhall Viva turned into our road. The house was full of half-functioning 14, 15 and 16 year olds; I particularly remember that the stairs, which faced the front door, were impassable, containing as they did 40 or so ruddily woozy teenagers. Empty cans and bottles (large cider bottles, in these pre-Sol days) covered every horizontal surface, and some of the vertical ones. And, most distressingly of all for them, the parquet floor in the hall was almost invisible beneath a couple of inches of liquid effluvium. What it was I don\'t know, and I didn\'t care because I was pissed and happy.\n\nKids were ejected, black bin bags were filled and mops were repeatedly wrung as Adrian and I put the house back together under the baleful gaze of my not-to-be-crossed mother, but whatever; in the back of my mind that thought was there again: gigs, y\'know, they\'re pretty fucking cool.',12),(13,'Hello from Hamburg! Ich Bein Eine Hamburger. Or something. Got an hour after breakfast on the bus before we have to travel to record a German TV show called Ina\'s Nacht, so what better way to make GOOD USE of my time than another quick session of bloggin\' the shuffle. This time off my lovely pink iPod, which always seems to make more interesting choices than iTunes on my laptop...\n\n<strong>Unbelievable Truth - History-Fiction - Misc. Music</strong>\n\nWell OK. Onanism again. As previously explained there is a lot of things that I\'ve worked on on here. This is a b-side with a rather nice cello part on. I enjoy arranging for strings, and did quite a lot of it in the UT days. It\'s a source of a little tension (only internally - I am English after all) that in The Sleeping Souls I don\'t get the opportunity any more. Matt covers that area and guards it well, so I bite my tongue rather than create conflict, ignoring anything I think I might have to offer. This song also featured a rather lovely Acousticaster guitar that I used to own, kind of like a hollow-body Tele with piezos under the bridge. Yum.\n\n<strong>Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach - God Give Me Strength - Painted From Memory</strong>\n<!--{m::2::n}-->&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--{s::2::n}-->\n\nNot enough people know about the album these two made together. It\'s very excellent. This song was written for a movie and was their first collaboration, leading to the full length Painted From Memory. It actually led to one of my first attempts at \'writing\'. A friend of mine worked for an arts paper in Cleveland and asked if I would contribute some reviews and stuff. I don\'t recall doing much but I did do a review about this record. And a \'review\' of the first trailer for Phantom Menace. I do enjoy writing, in much the same way as I don\'t enjoy talking. I\'m a pretty quiet guy, and I hate trying to interject myself into conversations, but I suppose if I\'m writing it\'s just me and my voice. I\'m not trying to impress anyone else, or thinking that everyone else in the conversation needs to be given time to be heard because IT\'S JUST ME. Being a touring musician who doesn\'t drink, smoke, take drugs, fornicate (much), goes to bed early and gets up before everyone else means I make do with my own company for large periods of my life. Which I\'m actually totally fine about, and writing is a reflection of that I suppose. All that said I\'m always hyper-aware of the pitfalls of self-analysation. Ask someone who knows me if you want a real view on it...\n\n<strong>Genesis - Afterglow - Live Over Europe</strong>\n<!--{m::3::n}-->&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--{s::3::n}-->\n\nThem again, recorded on their 2007 reunion tour. I went to see the tour, twice of course. Everyone has the right to a reunion, but despite my passion for them I can easily judge them as tired that time around. The tunes were all transposed down to accomodate Phil Collins\' stretched vocal chords, they played everything slower, and it was a shadow of the energy they used to bring to playing live. Again, a lesson. Always show up. Give it your all until you drop. There were three moments which were special - The Drum Duet, which was the only point of the show where they had developed and done something that they had never done before; Los Endos, which is so magnificent that it can\'t disappoint; and finishing with The Carpet Crawlers, which was unexpected and ace. Apart from that, it\'s time to fade away.\n\n<strong>Rockability - Dive Dive - Tilting At Windmills</strong>\n<!--{m::4::n}-->&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--{s::4::n}-->\n\nMe again. I have a difficult relationship now with Dive Dive. First we have so little time between tours that I want to see my kids before trying to rehearse and write another album (even though Jamie has a bunch of great songs already pretty much there). But additionally I spend my life now doing something that isn\'t quite me (love Frank and enjoy playing his music, but it definitively is not my stuff) that the idea of coming back and doing something which again is not entirely me (I have more ownership of Dive Dive, but it\'s still not embedded in my soul, and I defer to the other members in most things) is... I don\'t know yet. The song\'s finished. Time to move on from that thought.\n\n<strong>Kids Will Be Skeletons - Mogwai - Happy Songs For Happy People</strong>\n<!--{m::5::n}-->&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--{s::5::n}-->\n\nThe music industry is an odd thing, where quality is not any kind of guarantee of progress (see my blog on the earth-shakingly amazing Mark Mulcahy). Sometimes you can have a fantastic band where a member or members don\'t have sufficient work-ethic, or commitment, or the right attitude, and constantly torpedo their chances of forward momentum, or the opposite, where an average band puts the hours in and presses the right flesh giving them rewards unconnected to their ability as musicians. Or there is the ethereal mantle of coolness. Sigur Ros are, let\'s face it, very cool. Their early endorsement by Radiohead set them out on the right path, and their abstruseness helped. But Mogwai, who I would describe as being in the same area, are, in my opinion, waaaaay better. They never scaled the heights of Sigur Ros, at least not in perception, because they\'re a bit more straightforward personally, humbler, less pretensious. But the records are all infallibly amazing. Well done. Damn. It\'s finished.\n\n<strong>Ashes to Ashes - Faith No More - Album Of The Year</strong>\n<!--{m::6::n}-->&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--{s::6::n}-->\n\nA band who I actually proselytise about. They made one of the greatest albums ever made, but I suppose I should wait for a track from that album to come up before I chat about it. I really wanted to be Mike Patton for a few years. I had a ridiculous under-the-chin beard and emulated his clothing (long-sleeved t-shirt under normal t-shirt), but stopped short of the eyebrow ring or drinking of own piss. Which I think everyone agrees is probably for the best. I\'ve lost that sense of idolatry, which is perhaps sad, and maybe contributes to making it hard to get into new music - sometimes you need to be so dazzled by something about it, be that a personality or stylistic bent, that it suspends your analysation of what\'s going on.\n\n\n\nEnough for today. Thank you everyone for the suggestions on the last blog of this type, and I will certainly follow them up on Spotify. Yes, yes, I haven\'t already. Waiting for a quiet time when I can give it it\'s due. So that\'ll be sometime in 2014. Maybe.',13),(14,'Some things are curious to me. Things which appear to be a lack of analysis, opinions not properly thought through. Then again that sometimes is just me and my Spock-ness, not appreciating the random foible of desire.\r\n\r\nI read about the band that I play in on the internet. There, I\'ve admitted it. In idle moments I\'ll let my eye wander down tweets that mention Frank Turner, The Sleeping Souls and other such search terms. And there\'s stuff that comes up quite often, some tongue-in-cheek, some not. Professions of love and a desire to be \'an item\' with Mr Turner, and occasionally with the less bald, less short members of his musical quorum.\r\n\r\nApart from the obvious, it seems so disconnected with reality. Surely the most cursory of analysis would suggest how entirely \'not good\' such a situation would be? Do you want a partner who is not at home for a minimum of half the year? And while you\'re left at home to ruminate day after day on your own insecurities, how would it be if while the partner is away they are put into pseudo-social situations night after night? And if you were so inclined you could find many examples on social media of members of the opposite sex having their pictures taken with the object of your emotion and desire, and they are many a thousand miles closer to them than you are. It\'s a recipe for darkness and discomfort and misery and difficulty.\r\n\r\nI do generally try to be careful when it comes to complaining about any aspect of my job. It\'s a great living, and I\'ve worked very hard to achieve where I am, and I\'m aware that many people hanker after what I do and where I am. But hell - this is my blog, so I\'m allowed to say what\'s on my mind - right?\r\n\r\nI\'ve been thinking about this recently because at the moment there is someone I feel a bond with. I\'m not going to go on about it here - not only would that be entirely un-British, but there are a few markers I try and set up to contain my \'private\' life. Besides which if I can\'t express how I feel about her face to face and she needs to read it in a blog then I\'m in big trouble alreadyâ€¦ \r\n\r\nBut I\'m a worrier. And I know from past and difficult and destructive experience that the difficulties are extant and numerous. When all I can be for months is a voice on the phone, or the ghostly not-quite-looking-right-into-your-eyes presence of a collection of Skype pixels, distance creates itself. When times are hard and all I want to do is cuddle her and make her feel better I feel my dereliction of duty keenly. Just missing someone from afar is corrosive - not only for it cracking the door to primeval urges to seek comfort elsewhere, the missing itself becomes corporeal, a slowly leaking ulcer, a creeping menace. And I know and recognise that feeling that the awful loneliness just seems amplified by there being someone who you need and can make you feel better who you will have no real access to for days, weeks, months. And talking yourself out of the idea that maybe it would be better (for me, for us both) to sunder the bonds, that separation from no-one is easier to cope with than separation from a loved one.\r\n\r\nBah. And humbuggy bollocks. It\'s just stress, a brief time at home remaking the connections as best I can, with my children and friends, but with the cloudy wall of a new schedule of touring rushing towards me, sucking in the Manhattan Island (Genesis reference #2 of just this blog) of my \'normal\' life. And with this album becoming more successful tours and plans are stretching off further and further into the future, almost unthinkably far, and every time I come back my kids look older and every time I go away they miss me less. But fuck it. I\'m manning up, once more into the breach etc. etc.\r\n\r\nI hope you\'re getting used to the fact that these blogs are disjointed. Eventually they might even end up finishing right in the middle of a sente',14),(15,'<b>1982 - 1985: Above The Riverbed The World\'s Run Dry</b>\n\nMore gigs, better gigs. After the party we started to get a bit more serious with the school band, or as serious as you can be when you\'re 12 years old. We called ourselves Nightshade and had a stable lineup of Adrian playing guitar, his best friend (in fact to this day) Rik Pennington on bass, John Thompson playing some very new romantic keyboards, and with a lack of decisiveness, two singers sharing the larynx duties - Jason White, big brother of my best friend Darren and possessed of a fabulous voice but almost no charisma, and Chas Waymark, a very serious minded young man who had stage presence by the bundle but whose voice left a fair bit to be desired. It was still all cover versions although we were working towards some slightly more involved ones including Hallowed Be Thy Name by Iron Maiden<!--{s::1::n}--> and Forgotten Sons by Marillion.\n\nBy this point I\'d fully absorbed my brother\'s taste for the new wave of British heavy metal, but taken his side interest in prog rock right to heart. Marillion were for some time my favourite band, and I think at that age quite understandably so. For early teenagers of a more alternative bent there was nothing but the Smiths, but for those of us who wanted our morbid navel-gazing intellectual verbosity shot through with the guilty pleasure of lengthy guitar and keyboard solos there was no other game in town than Fish and his version of Marillion. He spewed words like a depressed Chambers dictionary while his compatriots managed to just about balance an old fashioned fascination with Genesis with a very modern (for 1983) frosty emptiness that the more downbeat end of the new romantics (Japan and some Talk Talk<!--{s::2::n}--> for instance) had popularised. But while Adam Ant and Marillion were bands I loved and listened to and analysed, it was once again down to Darren White to provide me with the first group that could capture my passion and obsessiveness.\n\nOverhearing me prattling on to Darren about Marillion, and liberating his tape of Genesis\'s live album Three Sides Live<!--{s::3::n}--> (which would be my first exposure to them), his dad gave me a copy of the first release on his new label, Tales From The Lush Attic<!--{s::4::n}--> by IQ. Thirty years in the future now I count myself incredibly lucky that I had this as a counterpoint to Marillion\'s debut Script For A Jester\'s Tear<!--{s::5::n}--> (they did love long album titles these prog rockers) and its follow up Fugazi (OK, not always). Marillion were signed to EMI and had a landfill of money pumped their way; the albums were produced by Top People in the best studios at great length, with every bass guitar note falling precisely on every kick, and all the other precision of production that money can buy. IQ\'s debut was recorded in 3 days in a cheap 16 track in Surrey, and entirely mixed on the 4th day. The sound quality is just above a demo, and much more reminiscent (I was to later discover) of the crunchy reality of late 70s DIY punk than the smooth productions of Yes and their ilk. The mix is even cooler. The second side is almost entirely taken up with the 20 minute track The Last Human Gateway. Apparently they only had time for two mix passes at it; first time through they got all the sounds for the different sections, figured out when the different channels should be on or off; the second time they committed it to tape. It\'s good but a long way from perfect - you can hear the vocalist cough between takes, and the most enormous keyboard gaffe in recorded history is left on.\n\nBut it transported me. Had I not heard this I fear I would have been condemned to a future of only accepting high quality major label production values and not being able to see beyond their tight confines. But this was home made DIY to the max, and absolutely no worse for it. Musically they were a hell of a band. The songwriting was wonderful and introduced me to the concepts of re-iteration of themes in a way that many of the meandering Marillion pieces (much as I loved them) didn\'t hint at. The lyrics, rather than the avalanche of words that I needed to look up in a dictionary (and then a thesaurus) before I could understand them, were a whole load of perfectly ordinary words in orders that made them strangely meaningless and meaningful at the same time, paving the way for a later fascination with Michael Stipe.\n\nAnd they were my first proper gig. I didn\'t have any desire to see Nazareth, much as I enjoyed it. IQ I was totally berserk about though, so when I got the opportunity to see them at the old Marquee club on Wardour Street in London I jumped at the chance. They had done a gig there that went down in their own personal history, on New Year\'s Eve 1984, and I would love that to have been my first proper show. I\'ve told people it was. Sorry to you guys. That was a total lie. It was in fact their first show of 1985, in February or thereabouts. Again knowing Darren was my lucky break. The Marquee was over 18s only and I was not far over 13, but Adrian, Jason, Darren and me were on the guestlist, and after a little humming and harring they let us in.\n\nAfter Hammersmith Odeon this was something quite different. A room painted entirely black that was about the size of two living rooms knocked through, with a Martin P.A. bolted to the ceiling amongst a haphazard selection of Par cans. No seats. And it was really quite smelly, being full of prog throwback hippy types. I remember the support band used a Korg Poly 6, but that\'s it. Sorry guys. I was stood in the middle of the crowd when IQ came on fully expecting to remain there for the entire show. But the moment they launched into Awake And Nervous the whole place went bananas and I was catapulted into my first mosh pit. Yes, moshing at a prog rock gig. As a tiny 13 year old everyone around took special care of me, even popping me out of the top of the pit and onto the stage when things got really rough. I remember being at the guitarist\'s feet looking somewhat apologetic before hurling myself back into the action.\n\nAnd that was it. I was lost. Thankfully IQ seemed to play at the Marquee about once a month, and I was at all of them. Awake And Nervous was immediately added to the Nightshade set, along with some Genesis, Def Leppard and Ultravox. And we booked ourselves a proper gig, almost. Eltham College gym had a stage, Jason got his dad to pull in a favour and provide a P.A., we invented a flimsy charity gig pretext (Amnesty International, you got lucky that night!) and boom! a gig.\n\nA drain blocked outside the fire exit, and it rained torrentially; the combination meant a cascade of water chose just before the start of our set to come pouring in by the side of the stage.<!--{b::1::r}--> It\'s quite possible my memory is doing that self-aggrandising thing that we are all so good at, but I\'m pretty sure I was the one that waded out into the minature lake forming outside and pulled the mass of leaves out of the drain, meaning we could go on without fear of massive electrocution.\n\nAs I linearly reminisce on my past I\'m waiting to find the moment when I became so caught up in music that it ended up being what I had to do, no matter what. This gig wasn\'t it again; it was fun, and, setting another future habit early, I enjoyed listening back to the tape we made of it, but it was just another night. I don\'t even remember talking to girls, dammit, although I know my brother\'s mate Seb, who was guitarist in one of the other bands, had a sister who was there - she\'s in the photos. Stewart Copeland happily claims that he lost his virginity on the occasion of his first show, but that wasn\'t on my cards. It didn\'t even seem to be in my pack.\n\nIn fact at this time, I wanted to be a stunt man much more than a drummer. I spent hours hurling myself off the small wall by the car park while waiting for my or someone else\'s mum to pick me up after school.\n\nIt was about this time that I stopped drinking. I know, I know, I only just started, but hanging about with my older brother and going to house parties with him meant that I had managed to fit a lot of activity into a short time. At any given opportunity I would knock back as much as I could possibly find of anything alcoholic and would be retrospectively amazed at the fact that it allowed me to talk to and, on one occasion that I can recall, dance with girls older than me when I couldn\'t even look a female in the eye while sober. The last time I remember being drunk was at a party around the corner from our house at the Arulambulem\'s. Suren, the older brother, was Adrian\'s friend and his sister Dhili was my age, so they tended to be our local playmates. At this particular party of their\'s I remember installing myself with another guy in the room where the drink was, and not leaving for the entire time until I was unable to do so. I giggled much and had to be dragged back the 60 or so yards to our house by Adrian.\n\nSo far so typically teenage (although at the time I was only 12). So why did I stop? The answer is I don\'t really know. I have a feeling it was as I was turning 13 and I wanted to seem more grown up. Since I had been drinking excessively at every opportunity as a 12 year old it seemed that one of the things I could leave behind as I became an official teenager was alcohol. A part of me also felt exposed and stupid when drinking. As much as it was an enabler of larking about and talking to girls, I always craved control and would look back on things I\'d done and said when not in control (either through drink or immature over-excitement) with terrified embarrassment. Whatever the reason, once I turned 13 I never touched alcohol again, except for a couple of times that we will get to in due course.\n\nBy this time I was also teaching myself piano. I had hammered away on the upright that we had acquired not long after the move to Highfield Road for hours on end with no discernible talent. Really, my parents, especially my mum who was there the whole time, were superhuman in the patience department; between the drums and the atonal piano the aural atmosphere of our household must have resembled some kind of Dante-esque psychological torture. To try and provide at least some harmonic structure to the noise they enrolled me in piano lessons with a very nice asian lady up the road. I struggled my way through to a grade 2 pass over a couple of years, but as I did so the amount that I played at home dwindled away until I was barely playing at all on my own time. Seeing this I was removed from the lessons; and inevitably my home playing recovered until I was back to hammering away for hours, although now with at least sufficient basic knowledge to try and figure out all my favourite IQ and Marillion songs. So I guess my parent\'s plan worked.\n\nTheir revenge for all my noise was coming though, in the form of a nuclear blast to the life. My dad - did I mention he was real smart? - had an opportunity that couldn\'t be turned down, an offer of a Professorship and research fellowship at Oxford University. The decision was made - Adrian was to see out his last year of school boarding at Eltham, while I was to move with mum and dad to Oxford and go somewhere new.\n\nI was very resistant. Most of my friends I had made at my primary school of Bickley Parva and then moved up to Eltham with, knowing them since I was 4 years old. I didn\'t relish the idea of suddenly having to deal with the social nightmare of being an early teenager and having to make a new set of friends.\n\nIn the run up to all this Nightshade began writing songs, the first original material that I had been involved in. I wrote some bits of keyboard, but the meat came from other people, mostly Adrian. The head of music at our school knew someone who ran a small studio built into their house and organised for us to go and record there (not for free, I might add, and I remember noticing early on how parts of the industry worked financially). We recorded 3 songs  on our first session (Married Yesterday<!--{a::1::n}-->, Waiting, which unashamedly nicked a part of a christian musical called Daybreak for it\'s middle section, and our big rock number Setting Sun) and went back some months later for a second two day session that yielded another 3 songs none of which I now remember. This second session we took along Roger Nunn, the big brother of Rik\'s friend Nigel Nunn (or big Nige as he was known to distinguish him from me), as a producer. I don\'t remember exactly what he did, but Roger was certainly a working drummer by that point and thus about 2000% more knowledgeable about the industry than us.\n\nThere were a couple more shows at our school and a smattering at other schools of people we knew coming up to the summer of 1985, but then it was time for our family to move away.<!--{b::3::n}--> Because he only had one year left of school Adrian stayed on at Eltham - he was doing very well there, head boy, captain of the athletics team, high flying academic over-achiever; I had just about managed to accrue some detentions and a reputation for being able to dive off a small wall without significant injury - but I was enrolled at Abingdon School near Oxford to continue my studies. I had made house-hunting a nightmare for my poor parents because I was so resistant to the idea of leaving all of the friends I had grown up with, but eventually we found a place in a quiet village called Marcham that I relented and didn\'t object to.\n\nWe moved on Sunday 14th July 1985. It\'s easy to remember the date, because the previous day the removal men had come and taken everything away except for some sleeping bags and, on my insistence, the TV which we would bring in our car the following day. Why the insistence? So I could watch Live Aid, which I did, from beginning to end, sat on the floor in a house with no furniture, no curtains, in fact nothing at all. I still vividly remember many bits of it - Queen and U2 at Wembley being utterly transcendentally brilliant, Phil Collins playing drums with both Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton at the Philadelphia show, and seeing INXS for the first time, doing Don\'t Change<!--{s::6::n}--> from Australian Live Aid - but it was shot through with contemplation about the fact that I was an awkward uncomfortable and ugly 13 year old who was going to be hurled into a new school and have to make a whole new set of friends. Bollocks.',15),(16,'As many of you here may know apart from being a drummer I was once a lighting designer, the guy who makes the lights do their thing at a rock show (there\'s many other kinds of LD of course, but rock was what I did). So with that in my background I have a keen interest in the \'putting on a show\' aspect of doing gigs.\r\n\r\nSome musicians seem pathologically averse to making any effort that way, which I find extremely odd. It\'s like they imagine that as soon as you employ someone to do your lights you become Pink Floyd.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/24Y3MK6KABU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nBut putting on a good show is as wide a remit as what makes a good band. Pink Floyd are a good live act; as are Fugazi, and Idlewild, and Adele, and Ben Folds Five, and Level 42, and Slipknot, and This Ain\'t Vegas, and PJ Harvey, and Emily Barker And The Red Clay Halo, and Larry\'s Flask, and on and on. And as diverse as those artists are, so is a show that will complement and amplify what they do onstage.\r\n\r\nWhich, to me, is the point. I see a strong linkage between drumming and lighting. Both are non-essential to songs existing, but they help if they\'re there. And if you do them really well and properly, 90% of the time people don\'t notice them in any specific manner. But they are aware of having been to a better gig. Of course there\'s the showy-offy 10% where you can try and do things that make people go \'ooooh!\' or \'wheeee!\', but that\'s not the meat and potatoes of the job. The middle bit (just after the keyboard solo) of made me giddy when I was 13, which is exactly when I started loving lights.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/_12_-jzqOlE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nWhen I was lighting I was looking for a visual representation of what was happening musically at that moment. Sometimes it\'s simple, and sometimes it\'s complicated, but when it seemed to be becoming \'part of\' the music then I was happy. And as long as you follow that rule then the lighting for all those bands I mentioned before will be completely different to every other.\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen loads of shows I\'ve really enjoyed, from Green Day\'s cartoony exploits with T-shirt guns and big brash looks, to aggressive asymmetry for Faith No More and oddball twitchy artistry for R.E.M. My two favourite shows ever are very different; The Invisible Touch Tour by Genesis (LD - Alan Owen)\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/qAdh85n1MjM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nwas an incredible bombastic treat, with Los Endos being a masterclass in knowing what to do and when, including the expected and the unexpected (tension and release being just as important to lighting as other artforms); and the In Rainbows Tour by Radiohead (LD - Andi Watson)\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Xjejiyx1vvY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nwas mindblowing, utterly original and technically off the chart - designed as an \'eco-friendly\' low power consumption rig that could be run off (large) batteries every other night.\r\n\r\nAnd it\'s VERY noticeable to me when people don\'t bother, which sadly two of my favourite bands didn\'t on a couple of occasions. The Ben Folds Five reunion tour last year was definitely understaffed, which really was taking the piss considering they were selling out Brixton Academy twice over. They\'re not a band that needs any kind of \'big\' light show. Something friendly and theatre-y that emphasises their performance is all that\'s necessary, adding a little visual flair for the people at the back, with knowledge of the songs and their dynamics being paramount. Same for PJ Harvey who I saw ages ago at Brixton Academy at the end of a very long world tour. Either the touring LD was sleepy and with the slowest reactions in the world, or they didn\'t bring anyone who knew the songs well enough to change lighting scenes at appropriate musical moments. Again, the Peej is not needing a supercharged Lady Gaga style show, but something simple that can track and complement (that word again) her shifts from swampy blues indie to torch song and back again. Someone to make it looks like the lights give a flying shit what the music is doing.\r\n\r\nSadly there\'s too many lighting people out there who were lighting technicians who got asked to design because they know how the gear works. Wrong way around, as far as I am concerned - it\'s much easier to teach how to strip and fix and rig lights than it is to teach sensitivity to music and dynamic and emotion and song structure. And the latter stuff is MUCH more vital to good lighting design.',16),(17,'Just got a little while in the middle of the night before we leave for Heathrow to start another tour. Although they never stop. It\'s one continuous tour.\r\n\r\nBut I was having some thoughts about work and working and who does what. I\'ve been both sides of the touring fence multiple times - being crew and being the \'artist\'. And it\'s a strange co-existence that the two sides inhabit.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it the crew are the people who are actually working on the road. I don\'t know of any sane musicians who would argue. Their hours are longer, their tasks are more arduous, and they don\'t get the high-pitched adulation that the band gets. I used to love being crew, particularly lighting. On a tour, only the caterers have longer hours. Lighting are in first and out last, and on a couple of tours I did there was hardly any break between those two things.\r\n\r\nThe band, by contrast, do little in terms of hours. A hour, maybe 90 minutes soundchecking during the afternoon. Another 90 minutes or a little more playing in the evening. It\'s not so hard. But at the same time none of the crew\'s work would be happening were it not for the \'artist\' and their endeavours. Some crew people do end up bitter or envious of band members, but everyone\'s relying on each other for the betterment of the show.\r\n\r\nAnd in many cases you\'ll find band members who are not coasting their way through things. FT busies himself deeply throughout any day. If he\'s not doing externally mandated activities (radio sessions, press interviews, TV appearances organised by the record label) then he\'s working through his day\'s mountain of email, both keeping an eye on business affairs and personally replying to every fan or otherwise person who wants to write to him. Tarrant and Ben have both also worked the other side of the fence (Tarrant has been a tour manager and FOH engineer of some repute in the past, and Ben has more than once earned a crust as a guitar tech) so they are also wont to roll some sleeves up and make sure stuff is being done - in Ben\'s case looking after his gear lovingly (and somewhat anally, to be sure), for Tarrant remotely managing his band van hire business hoovers up more time than he strictly has available.\r\n\r\nSo what\'s my point? There isn\'t one. Lame. But it\'s 2 am and I wanted to be in bed and asleep two hours ago and I\'m not going to see a bed for another 26 hours so no there\'s no point and what are you going to do about it?',17),(18,'<strong>1985 - 1989: Sentimental Mercenary In A Free Fire Zone</strong>\r\n\r\nAfter a summer of unpacking boxes and trying to make the new house a home I started at Abingdon School in September 1985. With the determination for morbidity that only a teenager can muster, I hated it and was depressed in a way I had never experienced before. All I wanted was to go back to South London and be with my friends, which I did for most weekends in September and October, taking the train from Didcot to Paddington, tubing my way across the capital to Victoria, and then the train down to Bickley, all on my own, which looking back certainly helped my 13-year old sense of independence. But day to day I was still at a school where I was having trouble making any friends.\r\n<!--{b::1::l}-->\r\nOf course I wasn\'t trying that hard. Each breaktime and lunch time I took a golf ball that I carried with me and kicked it in a slow slalom through the widely spaced trees down the driveway of the school, feeling as navel-gazingly sorry for myself as a teenager ever did. When October turned to November and it got too cold for that I would occupy a vacant classroom and thoughtfully bounce my friend the golf ball around that. I was, not to put too fine a point on it, an absolute laugh riot.\r\n\r\nThis period of navel gazing is integral to who I ended up being I think. If there is a time when music became solidified as the THING FOR ME then this was it. I hurled myself into practicing at home, both drums<!--{b::2::r}--> and keyboards (I had been parlaying my parent\'s guilt over taking me away from Eltham into new gear for sometime, managing to get a Korg Poly 61 synthesiser, a portastudio 4 track recorder and a new Tama drumkit out of it over the next couple of years), and thought about nothing but music during my miserable slalom, probably because the band was my only extant link to my old life - I was still the drummer for Nightshade and would rehearse on my frequent return visits to my old life, even managing a few gigs and some more recording. It also turned me from a relatively happy-go-lucky young man into the very serious furrowed brow that you now see before you.\r\n\r\nThis was accentuated by the first feelings of disconnectedness from the rest of the exponents in my chosen field. Rik, Nightshade\'s bass player, now occupied a flat above his father\'s jewelry shop with his brother, and away from parental influence. When I came down for rehearsals I would often stay the night there before seeing friends and returning home the next day. Those stayovers would mostly involve Adrian, Rik, Big Nige and sundry others drinking heavily in the living room while watching risquÃ© videos, all of which I had no interest in, so my memories of those times are sitting in the hall learning to play a few basic chords on Rik\'s 12 string acoustic guitar while listening to the sounds of merry hell coming through the wall. Even at the time it struck me that the activity in the living room was the accepted norm for how people should act in and around bands, and that I was a weirdo, but it never caused me a moment of wanting to be like that. Still, I felt isolated and often uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI did eventually start coming out of the fug however, once again via a musical link. I had been talking to almost no-one at the school to the extent that I later found out that for much of my first term my colleagues thought I was a very peculiar demi-mute freak. But as we were waiting for a teacher one day I overheard another boy showing off his new drum machine. I sidled over and tentatively started asking questions about it. Luckily the boy, Alan Welby, was a very friendly and positive fellow, immediately inviting me in to the conversation as an equal and a friend. I talked about my recently blackmailed portastudio and previous musical experience, no doubt exaggerating my 6 or so gigs into world tours undertaken before my move to the new school. But the ice was broken, and I slowly began to crack open my own shell, making a lifelong friend in another boy Ian Patrick, who would help me integrate socially both within the school and in the local town. I had also determined for myself that I would start pulling myself out of it, after one particularly teary afternoon when my mum told me she had been walking past the school at break time and spotted me on my own, head down, hands in pockets, slowly tracing my path up and down the driveway. She watched for half an hour until she couldn\'t take any more, and when she told me about it later she was crying, wondering out loud what she and dad had done to me. I was crying too, and I told her it would all be fine, and that I would sort my own bloody self out and that she shouldn\'t cry any more.\r\n\r\nAlan, being a talkative type, blabbed around about me resulting in a boy, who introduced himself as the \'manager\' of a school band, approaching me about using my portastudio to record his charges sometime during 1986. And this is the point where the path that I\'m on right now, sitting on this tour bus winging its way through Missouri, can be traced right back to, albeit with twists and turns and cul-de-sacs along the way. The band was called The Illiterate Hands (my god, the mid-80s public schoolness of it) and consisted of guitarist Matt Hawksworth, bassist Simon Gardner, keyboardist Jonathan Greenwood and, most importantly to me, singer Andy Yorke.\r\n\r\nNot that there was a flash of soul-mate recognition, not between two ridiculously emotionally guarded teenage boys. Initially all the talk was business between Jonny and I, bonding over the fact that we both used the same drum machine (an add on to the ZX Spectrum 48k called the <a href = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpecDrum\" target=\"_blank\">SpecDrum</a>). We discussed how to attack the recording of the songs that they had and set a date for them to come over to my house in Marcham to put it all together. Andy was very quiet throughout all of this - I had no idea what he thought about the whole thing, but carried on in the hope that he wasn\'t as angry as he looked.\r\n\r\nThe demo tape came out pretty well. It was all exceedingly twee, but we did a good job, getting 8 songs done in a day or two. My particular abiding memory of that is my first experience of Andy being able from time to time to transcend his natural downbeat grumpiness to do something that seems totally out of character.<!--{b::3::L}--> In this case there was a middle 8 in a song that had a jaunty musical theatre kind of feel, and I suggested a whistling solo (like I said, twee). Andy mumbled \'yeah, sure, I can do that\' and stepped up to the mic and let out a melody so happy and skippity and joyous that it reduced Simon, Jonny and me to asphyxiated hysterics as we tried to avoid ruining the take with audible laughter. Turning around to see us turning slowly purple he concluded his take with a deadpan \'what?\' prompting a massive outburst of laughs, but it was the perfect thing, delivered first take and almost in total contradiction of Andy\'s personality.<!--{a::1::n}-->\r\n\r\nI was happy to do the first demo their way, but with my penchant for Iron Maiden and Marillion, I certainly fancied reducing the twee factor. I suggested that maybe I could replace the SpecDrum in the band line up, so we had an audition in the school theatre. Since up to this point they had been rehearsing in bedrooms through tiny amplifiers the sheer sonic assault of a drumkit in full flight rather shocked them, so much so that using discarded scenery they built a sound baffle around me. Slightly surreal, being essentially inside a deep box with the rest of the band outside, and me having to pop up in the middle after each song to find out what they thought.\r\n\r\nAndy and I had begun to bond strongly by this point. He, in a transparent attempt to wean me off INXS, Marillion and Iron Maiden, made me an REM compilation tape which not only introduced me to my new favourite band, but also sealed my love of Andy\'s singing voice since he saw fit to include two tracks of him and his big brother Tom (later to gain an extraneous \'h\') singing together (one of the songs was Pale Blue Eyes by The Velvet Underground but the other has been lost in the mist of imperfect memory - I have a feeling it may have been Dreams by The Everly Brothers).\r\n\r\nNot long after this Tom, apparently jealous that his younger sibling\'s band had such a good sounding demo (!), asked if I would record some songs for his band On A Friday. Tom was already a known musical figure in the school, with a constant surly (but not unpleasant, if you get my meaning) attitude, long herringbone coat and army surplus satchel slung over his shoulders. The term before I arrived at the school there had been a semi-legendary production of the musical Joseph and his Technicolour Dreamcoat, where Tom had taken the vocal role of the narrator (Joseph was played by another person who\'d figure largely in my future, Jim Crosskey), so Tom\'s already phenomenal voice was well-known to the school. They had recorded demos in the school music room using a mate of theirs, and it seemed they fulfilled much of the same role that Nightshade had at Eltham, soundtracking school gigs and parties. The other significant outcome that the Illiterate Hands demo had was Tom press-ganging Jonny to join his bassist brother Colin in the On A Friday lineup, which in hindsight was a good thing.\r\n\r\nOAF had recorded three tracks at the semi-legendary Union Street Studios in Oxford but Tom was already a prolific writer and wanted to get another slew of stuff down, so we gathered in my bedroom for me to commit it all to portastudio.<!--{b::4::R}--> The wall to wall IQ, Marillion and Iron Maiden posters were anathema to the fearsomely indie five piece, but I don\'t think they let their prejudices get in the way (although there was plenty of good natured piss-taking, including a snap I still have of Tom, Colin, guitarist Ed O\'Brien and drummer Phil Selway posing ironically in front of one of my Maiden posters).<!--{b::5::l}--> I was quite proud of the work I did, and if I contributed anything to their development it could be that I encouraged Tom very strongly to drop the nasal American accent that he had thus far adopted on his recorded output.\r\n\r\nI had recording gear. There were bands at school. This made me somewhat popular. Alan Welby, my first point of contact with other humans at the institution, was bass player in a band that if I recall were at the time called Skag And The Gynecologists with guitarist / singer Jim Crosskey (he who played Joseph) and drummer Dan Shotton. I went over to Dan\'s house a mile up the road and about 12 rungs up the social ladder from mine to put tracks down for them. There was also People Like Us, led by enigmatic Rob Jolliffe and featuring drummer Martin \'Dig\' Diment who was amongst the group of close friends I was now developing, who I spent a pleasurable couple of days demoing around the keyboard player\'s house in Abingdon. Later on they would write and record one of my favourite songs ever to come from any Oxford band, called Nobody. It\'s a lost classic.\r\n\r\nIt was also during this time that Ian started dragging me down to a youth group called Quest, attached to St Helen\'s church in the town. This despite the fact that one of the offshoots of the move to Oxfordshire had been me quitting all kinds of church attendance, the first steps to my later total atheism. The only remotely interesting or relevant stuff to happen here, outside of all typical teenage development, was my first girlfriend introducing me to the entire back catalogue of Genesis. Her dad was a huge Genesis nut (I remember him driving us through Oxford with a bootleg of their <a href = \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h1GDSL1M98\" target = \"_blank\">1978 Knebworth show</a> on the cassette player) and she made me tapes of all their albums, starting a life-long musical love affair that despite all sensible arguments to the contrary continues to this day.\r\n\r\nI had come out of my shell much more now. Ian, Andy, Jonny and I had become our own little clique, congregating in break times and after school on a bench in Albert Park<!--{b::6::L}--> that neighboured the school. We named ourselves The Doomed Express, a phrase taken from a not massively memorable horror spoof called <a href = \"http://www.badmovies.org/movies/hysterical/\" target = \"_blank\">Hysterical</a>, that indicated our success rate in dealing with the opposite sex. Despite all that though that\'s the only thing that vaguely approaches the \"it\'s the best years of your life\" cliche, a group of four closely matched friends getting to spend time together every day just hanging out.\r\n\r\nNightshade continued, although now with Adrian as vocalist, and Roger Nunn came up to our house in Marcham to record another three songs with us (Arctic Summer<!--{a::2::n}-->, Thunder and Three Yellow Feathers, with me contributing lyrics here and there this time.)<!--{b::7::l}--> We managed various gigs and things, including our first absolutely real show out in the real world, at a pub on a dangerous street corner in far South London<!--{f::1::n}-->, and another at a club in Oxford as a co-headline with On A Friday. While we were writing more and becoming more ambitious the sporadic nature of rehearsing and gigging meant we could never get anywhere, even with Adrian\'s constant big brother berating of every tiny error he perceived on the drums. Despite the discomfort it did serve to make me acutely aware of my own contribution and give me the urge to chase perfection where I could.<!--{b::8::r}-->\r\n\r\nThings bounced along and developed wherever they could. A friend of Illiterate Hands\' from school had a dad who worked at a local manufacturer of mixing desks (SSL, one of the top professional desks in the world, built in the village of Begbroke just outside Oxford) and he wanted to introduce his son to the business, so it was suggested that he spend a couple of days recording us in their test studio at the factory. This was a great opportunity for a young band to spend some time in a top-class facility, and was amazing and instructive fun, especially since our friend\'s dad seemed quite enthused with the quality of the band and took over the session, not really giving his son a look in as he made everything sound as good as he could.<!--{a::3::n}-->\r\n\r\nThis was in the months running up to \'O\' levels, when of course I should have been working hard to secure my academic future. That summer I had an alternative big plan. I was going to hire a mixing desk to partner my portastudio and in swift succession record Nightshade, Illiterate Hands (on my advice they\'d dropped the \'The\' from the name, not the first time that this would happen), possibly some of my solo stuff that I\'d been writing and some solo songs for Tom as well. I remember that August being a great month, head down recording for almost the entire time. Nightshade had also cut a three track demo at Union Street and wanted to extend this to a \'full length\' demo tape to sell at shows, and similarly the Hands had the two tracks from SSL which we wanted to partner with another pile.\r\n\r\nOnce again I must significantly doff my hat to my long-suffering mum (dad worked long hours, so it was less of an imposition on him), who gave up her dining room and hallway as a recording venue and kept everyone supplied with tea and snacks throughout. Despite one or two disasters (including erasing a  few seconds in the middle of Nightshade track) everything came out sounding pretty good, but most valuably I once again learned a great deal about the whole process. The solo demos for Tom were particularly good, with some amazing vocal arrangements sung by him and Andy, the only time they appeared together on a proper recording until 2009.\r\n\r\nI passed my \'O\' levels with reasonable grades (except Art, which I failed dammit) and continued on into the 6th form at Abingdon. This wasn\'t my first choice though - by this time I was convinced that music was my life, and my first instinct was to leave school and go for it full time. Dad entered the fray and was very insistent that I should do \'A\' levels, and honestly I wasn\'t too worried about this being an argument that I lost - I enjoyed learning and could see the sense in having some further qualifications to fall back on if things were not to work out as hoped.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that I started noticing very distinctly a girl (let\'s call her X) whose walk to her school took her past me most mornings. It was by no means the first time I\'d seen her - my first girlfriend bruised me quite badly when my eyes lingered on this X for a little too long during a camping week with the Quest youth group, and I\'d seen her at Quest often after that - but she appeared to be maturing into my first and biggest adolescent obsession. I\'ve been mostly skimming over my interpersonal relationships, but this one is going to come up again and again, and have some relevance to who I am and what I do. Keep your eyes peeled.\r\n\r\nFor the time being though I started in on my choice of \'A\' levels (Physics, Maths and Chemistry; I hadn\'t done music at \'O\' level so it would have been difficult to do it at \'A\' level; balls) and kept at all the possible musical outlets I had. Nightshade had started upping the game a bit, made easier by the fact that both Adrian and Rik were now at University in Oxford. We changed our name to Kiss The Dirt (I\'ve no idea why substituting one shit name for another was deemed a necessity), moved me to keyboards, brought Roger Nunn in on drums and recruited American Betsy Oana on backing vocals, embarking on gigs in and around Oxford, many at college balls and events but venturing out into the town from time to time as well. Illiterate Hands were doing some gigs here and there also, including a couple of supports to On A Friday, even managing one show that achieved some small school-based notoriety. We played at the youth club in the centre of Abingdon and, despite the nature of the band, everything got somewhat raucous.<!--{b::9::r}--> The headmaster had words in assembly on the Monday afterwards, letting everyone know that a great many fixtures and fittings had been broken and that the owners of the club had been unimpressed by drunk teenagers vomiting off the balcony onto the crowd below. If this was supposed to shame anyone it really failed in its desire, just making the whole deal sound like the coolest thing ever. Even better, we were told that apparently the headmistress of St. Helen and St. Katherine\'s girl\'s school nearby was giving the same talk to her assembly, making the party sound even more unmissable. Apart from all this shenaniganing I was still teaching myself keyboards through the medium of learning other people\'s songs (mostly REM, Phil Collins, Queen and Genesis) whilst also writing various songs of my own. Overall it was an energising time.\r\n\r\nEventually, and through some dogged persistence, I ended up going out with X. She was my second official and proper girlfriend (it\'s true I came to this kind of activity later than many), with a semi-relationship with a very cool (in my eyes) singer guitarist that filled the gap between number 1 and X. With X it was a relatively typical relationship of that age (16 to 17) except for the fact that somewhere down the line I had decided that I wanted to save my virginity for the woman I would marry, so unlike some of my other enthusiastically rutting friends my physical activities were strictly of other, ahem, varieties. With the long period of hindsight allotted to me I have tried to analyse why X, over anyone else from my past, has exerted such a strong gravitational pull on my soul, and one of the few distinct differences that I could come up with between my relationship with her, and that of anyone else of that time, is that I never achieved an orgasm with her, perhaps leaving me with a sense of some unfinished business. Indeed X is the only woman with who I have found it necessary to fake an orgasm. God knows why; she was gorgeous and funny and flinty and I was nuts about her. Maybe it was nerves.\r\n\r\nShe left me after 10 or so months of boyfriend and girlfriending. It chucked me back into the depressed state of mind I had been in on my first arrival in Abingdon so much so that that when I saw her at the school ball to mark our graduation I experienced my first full blown panic attack (I hyperventilated to the point of passing out, which was a surprise to be sure). Thankfully the conscious miseryguts state didn\'t last too long, although I would later find out it had crept into my subconscious, into my soul, to grow like a cancer. But I now had another mistress in music, and one who would always react positively to the amount of work put in.\r\n\r\nI took \'A\' levels in 1989 and once again got reasonable, if not outstanding, grades. In fact in our household, with a Professor at the head of the table and my Oxford scholar academic brother to his right hand, I was a significant under-achiever, but I don\'t recall it even beginning to bother me. I was now definitely going to leave education. And I was going to do my level best to make music with every spare nook and cranny that my life would allow.',18),(19,'I said over there on the albums page that my next blog would be my own self-assessment of my solo work, but I think I\'m going to postpone that. It\'s something I struggle with in a way - I want to talk about it, but I would encourage anyone else away from that kind of coruscating critique of what they have done. But I\'m happy to be a hypocrite, so I\'ll save it for the next blog.\r\n\r\nI thought this time I\'d react to something on Twitter, that wasn\'t even directed at me. I don\'t remember the name, but in the aftermath of the UK arena tour being announced someone directed a tweet at Frank about not playing smaller places (one of many, and fair enough in some ways, everyone\'s entitled to their preference and opinion), and concluded their tweet with \"you\'ve changed, man\".\r\n\r\nFrank is usually polite about this kind of thing (at least in public - he can sound off in private about it) but as a third party I feel comfortable in expressing my thoughts. The summation of them is \"what a twat\", but that definitely needs some explanation.\r\n\r\nFirst is the dreadful presumption that this internet denizen knows Frank\'s mind, in the past or now, in any way. I\'ve known Frank for 7 years now, and in my estimation indeed he has changed, as hopefully any growing human interested in the world around them will inevitably do. And any of those ways of changing have nothing whatsoever to do with choosing appropriate venues for a tour.\r\n\r\nI would put it this way - I feel there was a tour where it was somewhat more reasonable to levy the \"this doesn\'t seem like the Frank Turner way of doing things\" tax on, but it\'s not next February. When I first started touring with Frank he was playing the biggest venues he could as a headliner, which happened to be 50 - 100 cap back rooms of pubs around the country. He wanted to put on the best show possible in those places, and if ticket price had been an issue he would have taken a keen interest in keeping it as reasonably low as it is possible to be. And for the most part all of his headline tours have followed exactly that template, very much including next February. The ticket prices are a much keener representation of where he is at.\r\n\r\nConsider - tickets are (I think) Â£22.50, which is lower than most bands who I see headlining arenas. Even if tickets had been Â£25 I don\'t think anyone would have blanched at the prospect, as that still comes in well below the Â£35 - Â£90 that I see advertised for the majority of shows of this size. If tickets had been that Â£2.50 more for the O2 Arena that would be a potential extra gross of at least Â£40,000. Gross mind - there\'s myriad expenses on a tour of this size, and none of them come cheap. Would none of us been tempted to nudge up the price a bit, still to a reasonable level, to be able to save for the uncertain entertainer\'s future that bit more? But Frank hasn\'t changed - what\'s the lowest we can do tickets for without risking shirt? OK, that\'s the price.\r\n\r\nSo Mr Twitter Twat was complaining about venues being too big. The UK tour earlier this year though, that\'s the one I would consider the \"you\'ve changed\" banner being hung upon. Although still technically signed to Xtra Mile, the licensing deal with Polydor (for the UK) means they have the lion\'s share of influence over what they would like to happen. They, in concert (hah!) with promoters, suggested kicking the album campaign off with what\'s called an \"undersell\", where a band goes out and plays places that are too small for them, they sell out instantly, create a buzz that the record company can play on to promote the upcoming record, and hopefully high chart positions ensue. So that\'s what happened, and you know what? I think it was a shitty move.\r\n\r\nSure, personally I much prefer playing rooms of that size, but for the fans it\'s elitist bullshit. They all (Scotland excepted because they hate us) sold out within the first couple of days of being on sale, with London going in 15 or so minutes. So everyone else is left with the choice of not seeing an artist they want to see, or paying through the nose at a secondary ticketing site or on eBay. Am I the only one who sees the problem here? Because the record company want to do something a certain way genuine fans end up having to pay more.\r\n\r\nOf course there\'s the \"playing multiple nights somewhere smaller\" argument that gets tossed about, and theoretically I\'m in favour of that. I say theoretically because in actual reality where I spend 10 months of the year on the road and miss my children like a severed limb anything that keeps the touring shorter is a great boon. We have shows booked either side of the UK arena tour stretching off around the world for a long time, all of which it should be noted are in the biggest venues we think we can play, and I would also appreciate Frank\'s back not collapsing under the strain of totally constant touring, so in this case, short is good. Maybe there\'ll be a less busy period at some point where we can tour the UK again for a four week stretch camping out for multiple days at venues, but not at the moment.\r\n\r\nIt\'s an odd clash of desires. As a band it\'s exciting when a show sells out, and we kind of hope for them to do so. But as soon as one does it means there\'s someone who can\'t get in, which gives an immediate whiff of elitism. And, internet person, with approaching half the tickets gone for the February tour in one week of sales (except for Portsmouth which is most likely already sold out, and Edinburgh which surprisingly is almost there as well), it seems that these shows will sell out, so we\'re possibly excluding people again. Which is not nice.',19),(20,'Been a while since the last blog. I guess I\'ve been putting this one off because... well it\'s odd. For starters I\'m aware that I would suggest to others not doing this - you let people take what they want from music you make, and your opinion doesn\'t matter so much once it\'s out there to the world. It\'s also emotionally opaque, having to analyse why I don\'t like (and even more painfully for a modest Englishman say why I actually do like) aspects of what I have done on my two solo albums.\r\n\r\nA bit of background first, as in why the hell would a drummer have a solo album, let alone two? I was in a band that I loved and was very committed to for a long time called Unbelievable Truth, and was part of the writing and creative process. When the singer finally called it a day in 2000 I was still in the habit of writing, and already had some bits that were intended to be worked on with Andy and Jase (my UT band mates). With the band gone I didn\'t want to just stop being a musician so I started putting the music together. However two things pushed me towards making it my project. First was the trauma (I know that sounds overstated, but... I\'d need a book to explain why it\'s an appropriate word) of UT splitting up meant I wanted to not have to rely on anyone else. But also I wasn\'t confident enough (jesus, what? another bracket? the UT breakup had hurled me depressionwards and hacked heavily into my self-esteem) to think that anyone else would want to be involved in any music I was making - but I still wanted to do it my way. So there.\r\n\r\nI did get Jase involved a fair amount, because I totally trust and love him, and really I know that I\'m better as a collaborator than doing everything on my own. But paranoically I wanted to keep it all close to my chest.\r\n\r\nMiseryguts came out in 2003, although it was a slow process from the first track being finished in 2001. I sent it to lots of places for reviews (which weren\'t too bad) and made it available through my website, but never even tried to get involved with a record or distribution company, again through the battered self-esteem. Anyway - here\'s my take on what I did:\r\n\r\nBeginning To Wonder: one of the earliest things I wrote, putting the riff together backstage at a UT show supporting Tori Amos as I recall. It\'s not a bad riff, but immediately we hit the thing that is my biggest hurdle to respecting my solo work. I\'ve been fortunate to have been involved with some exceptional singers in my career. Working with Andy Yorke and Mark Mulcahy, or even the very distinctive Jamie Stuart, rather leaves most other vocalists in the world wanting. I\'ve always thought I had a good backing vocalists voice - it always seems to float unobtrusively but audibly and not have too much personality of it\'s own, acting much more as an enhancer to whatever the main vocal is doing. But as a lead voice it\'s... ok. Just way waaayy not as good as mssrs Yorke and Mulcahy. And it\'s the most important thing in any band / act / recording. Songs finished. On to the next.\r\n\r\nGhosts: An interesting set of chords, particularly the first mental C chord which was the impetus for the whole progression. The backing was supposed to be a little like Squonk by Genesis - I like the low end simplicity of removing bass guitar and using a (sadly not real) Moog Taurus.\r\nThe \"look into my eyes\" vocal bit makes me cringe. My lack of confidence vocally is also represented by not being able to leave my vocal uneffected (a bit of distortion and some doubling for this song).\r\nThe mellotron / guitar solo bit was a reference to an Aimee Mann song I love. Some cool drum breaks in the end section.\r\n\r\nBlind Man: Collaboration - Jase\'s crazy pitch-shifted bass parts make this song. The slide guitar riff was left over from a previous band (Mundaka) and repurposed. I kind of like the \'round\' vocal. I find melodies really hard. I can make music all day and night but until there\'s a good vocal melody to tie it into a song music is meaningless smoke. Andy Yorke\'s melodies were always effortless and sublime, and once again I felt I could never truly match up. Why isn\'t someone else singing, dammit?\r\n\r\nPleasure Babies: I\'m sure there\'s a good song in here somewhere, but this arrangement sounds all congested and depressed and doesn\'t do it justice. Another example of how collaboration is better - there are ideas that are good here (the Jackson 5 electric guitar for instance) that needed someone to say \"that\'s a good idea, let\'s use it in a different song where it works better, eh?\"\r\nNice intro. This song is about my \'Amy\'. More super treated vocals so I (as a producer) can pretend it\'s not me singing. Outro is good too. Should have used those bits, built something else and jettisoned the rest maybe? Me and a Motown pop song clearly don\'t mix well.\r\n\r\nEverlasting Mile: more over-production and aural depression. I really like this song, especially when I just play it on piano. But like the second UT album I was trying to do something \'modern\' and \'progressive\' and \'edgy\' and the song itself suffers for it. The singing in this doesn\'t make me want to chop my own liver out and feed it to ducks (except the odd over-emoted word). Maybe I should write everything in G#. I believe I was mid-way through playing this song at the last solo show I ever did, when my lack of self-confidence got the better of me. I suddenly halted and walked out and haven\'t played any of this live since then. I think that was 2008.\r\n\r\nDirections: My first post-UT release, I put this out on my website in 2001 not long after our retrospective Misc Music came out. Andy really likes this song. If we ever do any more UT gigs I might get him to sing it. I really enjoy all of the ebow acoustic guitar stuff that\'s going on in the background. In my mind the acoustic guitar solo was supposed to sound like Wish You Were Here. I know it doesn\'t. Lovely BVs from Jase.\r\n\r\nDeep Cover: another song that sounded delicate and lovely (although fiendishly difficult) on acoustic guitar, and didn\'t necessarily survive the transplant to a \'full band\' arrangement. Lyrics inspired by glumness and a Lawrence Fishburne / Jeff Goldblum film. Got my friend Ken Turner (no relation) in to do a guitar solo. He did 6 or so versions and I edited together all the best bits. Nice solo. Mmmmmm. Nice.\r\nAs with everything else though, it feels like the melody is written my an instrumentalist rather than a singer. It feels thought about and smart and planned instead of instinctive and touching and sincere. It\'s one of my main problems with this album.\r\n\r\nInto The Hills: When I played a few shows this song became much heavier, first inspired by Loz Colbert (Ride drummer who I was honoured to have play for me) and particularly when Matt (Nasir) came in on guitar later. Better that way, really. Collaboration is an advantage, taking things ways you wouldn\'t necessarily have thought of without prompting. Interesting lyrics, in that they\'re all lovey dovey but not inspired by someone who I was in that kind of relationship with, Canadian singer songwriter Emm Gryner. The line \"when you\'re not here the Chrysler Building is the only beautiful thing in New York\" came when I arrived there to do some house shows backing her up, with the rest getting jotted down on the bus ride to upstate NY.\r\n\r\nThis Isn\'t What I Expected: Bigging myself up, I really like the lyrics to this song - the verse and chorus support the sentiment of each other and work as whole. And again, it\'s not bad, but needs a good singer and someone to tease the best out of the melody. To illustrate what I was saying before about the melodies not being instinctive: for this song I had it all but needed a chorus. So I started on the lowest note I could sing and worked my way up to the highest, as a conceptual way of making something happen. And it\'s fine, but I feel I can detect the artifice behind it, when all the best vocal melodies seem to me to float free of any musical intention and sublimate into just communication.\r\n\r\nGulag Parenting: Another lyric I\'m quite proud of, since the gulag (Russian prison) parenting could refer to being psychologically trapped by your own upbringing, or being a parent yourself. I didn\'t really have a concept for the drums on this until I did a rehearsal with Loz and played it this way. Did I mention the benefits of collaboration? I did have to push from my mind that this was the guy who FUCKING PLAYED LEAVE THEM ALL BEHIND!!! in order not to be over daunted, but he\'s so lovely that it was easy.\r\nFor a purported \'prog\' album (that was what I wanted to make) here\'s the first keyboard solo of the whole thing, inspired by Martin Orford\'s wonderful solo on IQ\'s Headlong. When we did this live we ended with a drum workout echoing a fantastic Mogwai gig I\'d seen. Let\'s pull lots of disparate influences together, huh?\r\n\r\nYou Get My Best: The last song written for the album. The UT publishing deal was up for renewal, and this was my last best hope to keep the contract in place, so I took it in a played it for them. No dice. It was a depressing night, and no good for my esteem (of course) - they decided that they were dropping me and Jase, even though I was still writing and doing stuff (not just this, but Good Show by Dive Dive was just about to come out and we were very active, plus a few other projects I was involved in), but were going to keep Andy on even though he was determinedly and deliberately doing nothing musical at all.\r\nThis song is about my kids.\r\n\r\nChasing The High: This was actually written and pretty much finished for pre-UT band Mundaka, but I wanted to revive it. I\'m sure I could like this if it wasn\'t my voice singing. I like the vocal effects on this one. Took quite a while to put together - lots of different treatments that fade in and out and take over from each other. This song is my best bass playing on a record. Really desperately wanted to be Jon Evans from Tori Amos\' live band on this. Or Bruce Thomas of The Attractions in his calmer moments. I like playing bass. I should do it more.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it. I\'ll do album 2 another blog time. But reading it back it seems like my real problem is I just didn\'t really want to make a solo album. I wanted to work with other people but felt cornered into not being able to, both physically and psychologically. Would love to hear your reactions. Particularly the ego-boosting ones. :)',20),(21,'I was intending my next blog to be another \"Bloggin\' The Shuffle\", but something happened that took me elsewhere. A friend who is studying screenwriting asked me about musical structure. Most screenplays follow a three act format, roughly akin to sonata form in music, and her thought was to compare other musical forms to see if there was a way to employ them as frameworks for a screenplay.\r\n\r\nI love films, and screenplays. I haven\'t studied remotely formally, but I\'ve read a few books about it, and the question got my creative juices flowing. So rather than just give her a simple, easy answer, I ended up writing a bloody essay, and, despite it\'s pretentiousness, I thought I\'d share it here.\r\n\r\nOne word of warning - it\'s mammoth. You should know before beginning. Trying to take the whole lot of it in at one sitting could be painful. I will have nothing but the utmost respect for anyone who can ingest it without gagging. But you be the judge -let the ponciness begin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Introduction</b>\r\n\r\nIn order to start from a knowledge base on which I am sound and expert, I\'m going to concentrate on the form of a pop or rock song. I know a bit about other areas of music, but I feel I would have most to contribute in this area due to long term exposure to and experience with this form. To give this analysis some depth from the musical side of the fence, I\'m not going to restrict myself to just structure however. In pop and rock, over and above most other musical forms, the song arrangement is as important to the temporal \'journey\' of the piece as the structure itself. I\'ll deal with definitions more thoroughly after this introduction.Â \r\n\r\nI am going to relate my deconstruction of song structure to my limited \'amateur\' knowledge of screen writing, informed by much film viewing (like everyone) and the reading of a few basic popular texts on the matter (Story by Robert McKee, Adventures in the Screen Trade and What Lie Did I Tell by William Goldman, Bambi vs Godzilla by David Mamet, screenplays by Quentin Tarantino, James Cameron, The Cohen Brothers and Lawrence Kasdan. I would love to quote from these sources, but sadly my reference works are all at home and I am on a bus in Minneapolis).\r\n\r\n<b>Structure and Arrangement</b>\r\n\r\nRock and pop are instinctive disciplines with no formalised structural requirements. Indeed, in rock music (nowadays an extremely broad term that can cover a huge range of styles) a bewildering myriad of song structures can be found, ranging from a single section repeated from beginning to end (employed by Philip Glass-inspired art rockers such as Laurie Anderson, for instance, or techno artist such as Leftfield whose music can still be said to fall under the umbrella of \'rock\') to structures that meander or barely repeat themes or ideas at all (progressive rockers such as Yes have employed this approach from time to time, or techno or EDM artists at the more extreme end of the scale such as mu-ziq, Squarepusher or Aphex Twin). Pop music also deviates in structures often and creatively, although within the confines of \'pop\' music (that music which is made for the <i>sole</i> aim of broad-based appeal and commercial success) the structural possibilities are somewhat more restricted.\r\n\r\nHowever there can be said to be a generalised accepted form, with some options, which is adhered to by a majority of songs from these genres. Two of these options would be:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Introduction (intro)</li>\r\n<li>Verse</li>\r\n<li>Chorus</li>\r\n<li>Verse</li>\r\n<li>Chorus</li>\r\n<li>Middle 8 (M8)</li>\r\n<li>Chorus</li>\r\n<li>(Chorus)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Intro</li>\r\n<li>Verse</li>\r\n<li>Chorus</li>\r\n<li>Verse</li>\r\n<li>Chorus</li>\r\n<li>M8</li>\r\n<li>Verse</li>\r\n<li>Chorus</li>\r\n<li>(Chorus)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p><p>\r\n(an important semantic note to be made here - some terms are different on opposite sides of the Atlantic. The terms I\'m using are the accepted British usage. Particularly within the US you will find a confusion in the uses of \'bridge\', and other terms that are used in different ways such as \'middle 8\' and \'turnaround\'. I\'m sticking with what I know best, so there)\r\n\r\nAnother very commonly used adjustment to either of these structures is the addition of bridges - small sections that act as a link between verse and chorus, or between chorus back to verse. Once more it is important to stress that there is no prescribed language that is used here, and many bands and artist develop their own short-form way of identifying sections. I am using what I believe to be language that in general is familiar to the majority of musicians, but it will equally not be uncommon to come across those whose vernacular is entirely removed from this.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clarity of purpose however I am going to eliminate bridges from my consideration here, and concentrate on the possibilities generated from the two very close examples given above.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the introduction, in pop and rock music, over and above most other musical forms, arrangement is as important to the effectiveness of the final effect as structure. Structure and arrangement can be usefully divided such:\r\n\r\n<i>Structure</i> - musical sections consisting usually of chords and a melody, organised into a format determining when each section should happen and for how long\r\n\r\n<i>Arrangement</i> - what the different instrumentation employed by the ensemble performing the song will do in each section, including the sounds used and the way the music is performed\r\n\r\nIt would be the subject of a whole other long (and possibly contentious) essay, but it is my absolute belief that what people perceive as pop music is as much reliant on how the arrangement is employed as it is on the chords, melody, lyrics and sequence of sections. Two brief examples to illustrate:\r\n\r\nDancing Queen / ABBA. It is possible to play the chords to this song and sing the words and melody and it to be easily recognisable as Dancing Queen. However to be the \"Dancing Queen\" that is popularly accepted as definitive the arrangement must be present and correct from the word go - the sweeping string melody of the intro overlaying the almost lazy disco-esque rhythm track, punctuated by the grandiose piano chords is inherently welded to the existence of the song, as much as the actual chords and vocal melody\r\n\r\nBorn Slippy - Underworld. I will be at risk of repetition here, but utilising a very stylistically different example. The basic chords and rhythmic, almost rapped vocal \'melody\' could be played on piano. But to prick someones ears hearing it across a crowded restaurant where a radio is playing, the echoed keyboard chords, using exactly that sound, chased out of existence by an unmistakably insistent kick drum must be present and correct. The structure, songwriting and arrangement are absolutely reliant on each other in the most empirical form to create the desired effect.\r\n\r\nSo now, finally (jeez, finally), I\'ll go through the structure of a song and relate it to my meagre screenwriting knowledge.\r\n\r\nSong and Screenplay Structure Compared and Contrasted\r\n\r\n<i>Introduction</i>\r\n\r\nWhile this may be an unrelated piece of composition, more often than not it will be sourced from two possibilities: an instrumental play-through of the chorus or verse, shorn of vocals, possibly with an instrument taking the dominant vocal melody. Arrangement-wise this will often be kept simple and frill-free to act as a simple and undaunting gateway into the song for the listener, while stating clearly some of what to expect - getting people into the right mood for the rest of the song, so to speak.\r\n\r\nThe obvious movie structure parallel to the \'chorus first\' intro comes from action movies, with the initial, sometimes pre-credit, action sequence. James Bond movies have been particularly dogged in their use of this trope, from the first to the last, and cleverly modulating that expectation over the more recent films. Casino Royale for instance had a pre-credits sequence much more downbeat than that of any of its predecessors, and in a single expert piece of screenwriting set the stage (\'got people in the mood\') for the rebooted Bond - there is still going to be action, but it will be more brutal and grounded in reality, and you are going to be faced with a new James Bond who allows self-doubt and seriousness to be part of his makeup. Without this nuanced short section it would have been quite possible the jarring of audience expectation and what the movie was delivering would have taken much of the first act to get through, by which time trying to re-engage the audience would have been an uphill struggle.\r\n\r\nOutside of action genres the \'verse as intro\' structure is much more easily identifiable. A short scene, often character based, that hooks the audience in with some story elements, but far more importantly emphatically sets the tone for what is to come. The level of camp, how much suspension of disbelief will be necessary, whether the screenwriter wants to bring the audience in on ironic self-awareness or affect them from afar with dramatic frigidity. And of course ever other option and possibility in-between or unmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe credits sequence of Silence Of The Lambs is masterful in this regard. Wordless for the most part, between the simplicity of the script combined with precise editing, direction and cinematography we as the audience already instinctively know, and are prepared for, important parts of the story. There is a sense of mystery and ominous danger; our main character (whom we will soon find out is named Clarice Starling) is a slight woman whose face instantly betrays steely determination overlaying a vulnerability we can\'t quite yet put our finger on; she\'s part of a team (all of the identically dressed joggers) but yet somehow stands apart. And simpler signposts - we\'re dealing with the FBI; it\'s autumn; Clarice is physically strong, which effectively reaches all the way to the end of the film, pre-empting and underpinning her final confrontation.\r\n\r\nAt a far simpler and lower-budget end of the scale we find similar \'this is what you\'re going to get\' scenes opening Clerks and Primer. Clerks is simplicity itself, acting like an establishing shot of the convenience store which is almost the only setting in the movie, while simultaneously providing a simple explanation for the total lack of daylight throughout the internal scenes of the movie (caused as I\'m sure you know by Kevin Smith only being able to shoot through the night in the store he worked at) and pre-figuring the multitude of creative (and, let\'s be honest, badly line-read) swearing that is one of the backbones of the movie. Primer is almost simpler still, saying \"here are the main characters, there will be questions, it will be mysterious, and you may not have a clue what\'s going on at some points. But it\'s OK - we know what\'s going on and you\'re in safe hands. Trust us\".\r\n\r\n<i>Verse One</i>\r\n\r\nAlmost too simple to describe in songwriting terms. Something will empty out from the arrangement of the intro to provide space into which the vocals will step, with the initial lyrics hopefully pulling people in, beginning the setup of the \'story\' of the song and further emphasising what to expect as things go on. To contrast - Invisible Touch by Genesis, we have come through the \'chorus as intro\', much of the aggressive guitar and keyboard has disappeared to open up the verse which now relies on small rhythmic guitar work and a warm synthesiser chord bed. The vocal begins, spacious and with a simple unadorned melody. We\'re in a pop song, it\'s not going to demand overly of you, you can enjoy it if you want.\r\n\r\nOver the page we have Recovery by Frank Turner (I know, using examples I\'m familiar with - shoot me). Dispensing entirely with any intro it plunges straight into the first verse, slightly conflating the both sections by using a stripped down arrangement that suggests a precursor to the song, despite the fact that it\'s already begun. And the words are instantly a barrage, with the melody climbing up and down like a spider monkey who has missed his Ritalin dose. So this verse one says: this is going to be fast, and complicated, and you\'d best employ at least some of your brain power in trying to keep up. A challenge of a verse.\r\n\r\nThis seems to chime nicely with the traditional Act 1 opening of most screenplays. You find telling scenes that establish your characters and their motivations while laying out the first cogs of the plot engine, most of the time pacing yourself so that you have somewhere left to go later on, unless you judge that the film requires a hell for leather approach. I always loved the merciless approach of the screenplay to Speed, starting so in media res that it almost seemed like the Act 2 (or even Act 3) climax was happening within the first few pages. That said it did seem to write itself somewhat into a corner, with the final chase through the subway seeming almost tacked on, and a slightly anti-climactic way to tie the loose plot ends into a neat bow.\r\n\r\nHowever, tracking the song structure analogy pulls us away from the \'verse one as act one\' possibility, since we don\'t want to finish our verse on the dramatic pivot point of an Act 1 climax. It wants to rise up certainly, but the burst of song energy that most closely relates to the conclusion of an Act is saved for our next section.\r\n\r\n<i>Chorus 1</i>\r\n\r\nFinally the tension of the song releases itself, if only temporarily, for the bit that people recognise from the radio, or want to sing along to, or want to bathe in emotionally. Quite often the listener won\'t even consciously realise they are being teased, but within the song that is often what is happening - Invisible Touch rises back up to the grand sound of the intro that people are pleased to have back, and the intro / verse 1 of Recovery finally explodes into life, trumpeted before it\'s entry by a magnificent drum break.\r\n\r\nIn many arrangements the tension / release is made far more obvious - Pixies (and indebted to them, Nirvana) made a point of the quiet verse stretching out the tension as the listener waited for the rock explosion that they knew was to come. No musicologist has ever put it better than Beavis and Butthead commenting on the video for Creep by Radiohead\r\n\r\nBeavis: Why do we have to have the bit that sucks? Why can\'t we just have the bit that\'s cool?\r\nButthead (sagely): Because, Beavis, without the bit that sucks, the bit that\'s cool wouldn\'t be as cool.\r\n\r\nSo far, so three act structure - this is essentially the Act 1 climax. In our action paradigm you roll out your first big set piece, into which you stir the beginnings of your conflict or difficulty to carry us through Act 2, harking back to the \'intro\' action beat, but hopefully upping the ante satisfyingly. In other genres, you bring together all the characters and dramatic beats that have been developing through \'verse one\' and watch the sparks fly, be they sadness, drama, fucking, whatever.\r\n\r\n<i>Verse 2</i>\r\n\r\nWhen done expertly, now the lyrics will start enriching and rounding the \'story\' of the song, over the same melody (although often with additional inflections and adornments) and chords as verse 1 (this is not always the case, but for the purposes of this verbose pile of blah we\'ll keep it simple). A skilful ensemble will adjust the arrangement to hold interest while keeping the section recognisably related to the first verse. For Invisible Touch, this means an identical arrangement to verse 1; in Recovery it\'s a much simpler approach; since the first verse did double duty as an intro, this is the first time the \'true\' verse arrangement appears.\r\n\r\nIf one was to base a screenplay structurally on this approach this is where the difficulty would lie, in terms of skilful writing to hold audience attention. Normally at this point we would wish for the tentacles of fate and difficulty to begin entangling and impeding our protagonist(s), forcing them to dig ever deeper to keep moving towards their goal. However this is \'verse 2\' - a restatement of verse 1 while shifting the chess pieces of the plot gently up their ranks, and stirring in subtly different flavours and spices. It\'s not impossible of course, but reading first draft screenplays and comparing with final shooting scripts this is the area where you often find extensive editing, moving important beats into Act 1 and losing others, combining characters so that more can be dealt with in a shorter space of time without having to restate anything. In screenwriting terms it would be far too easy for \'verse 2\' to become an unnecessary exposition of \'verse 1\' while adding too little to be of intrinsic value as a stand alone structural element. And, as William Goldman says, screenplays ARE structure.\r\n\r\n<i>Chorus 2</i>\r\n\r\nVery often identical to chorus one. Indeed pop music will often copy and paste many (or all) of the elements from one to the next. Although I don\'t believe it employs that copy and paste method, listened to in isolation one would be hard pressed indeed to differentiate chorus 1 and chorus 2 of Invisible Touch, outside of the last two notes of the vocal melody. Recovery, despite being played throughout, also is all-but identical in these two sections. \r\n\r\nMaybe I\'m too traditionalist but once again we hit a problem with drawing analogies between this and screenwriting. Unless it\'s an arty movie where one can defy convention and have identical, or nearly identical scenes (perhaps though flashback or change of perspective), then we would have to translate this chorus as an Act 2 climax, the final conflagration of the steepening odds being faced and the impetus for the protagonist to step outside themselves and become something other than what they were, simultaneously bursting the bonds of difficulty for them and the audience, and providing a satisfying character arc for the struggling screenwriter sweating over every last syllable and beat.\r\n\r\nBut without the additional complexity provided by a traditional Act 2, rather than the more flaccid \'verse 2\', such a climax would seem out of step, an orgasm before the foreplay.\r\n\r\n<i>Middle 8</i>\r\n\r\nThey come in many forms in songs, including someone just playing a guitar solo over an instrumental verse. But for the purposes of \'academic\' simplicity we\'ll concentrate on middle 8s that are distinct sections.\r\n\r\nA good middle 8 can be an elusive thing. Your ideal is something that is sufficiently in keeping with the rest of the song that you\'re not jarring your listener out of the \'moment\', but something distinct enough that it informs and enriches what has come before, and leads smoothly to what comes after. Continuing to use our two examples, which I randomly picked way back when, and now kind of wish I\'d thought of something better, especially since neither of them actually follow the first structure I was talking about - Invisible Touch jumps up a key unexpectedly, and while it hangs onto this one chord that has not previously been heard in the song the keyboard parts \'fantasia\'. Continuity with the rest of the song is maintained through the rhythm track which remains constant, give or take a couple of drum breaks. Recovery is a little more involved. At the front of the middle 8 it gives the first breather of the song, the listener having been battered alternately with the verse\'s barrage of lyrics and the bombast of the chorus. It then jumps back into type, this time with the rhythm track deviating from it\'s previous comfort zone while the vocal delivery stays true to the machine-gun style of the verses, as the lyrics introduce a new sympathetic character to the story in preparation for the final verse.\r\n\r\nThe middle 8 then is the traditional Act 2, where complications abound, generating a forward momentum to carry the viewer into Act 3, while still staying thematically and tonally true to what has come before. Unless you\'re watching From Dusk \'Til Dawn, when the beginning of Act 2 is the time to completely change the theme and tone of the first act as a way of pulling the carpet out from under the audience. And again tradition pushes against the possibility of using this song structure in traditional story telling - the story turning of the Act 2 climax has already happened, and whether consciously or not the audience will now be willing the protagonist to begin the process of mastering his opposition. Ladling more onto him / her / it at this point would unsettle or confuse the audience perhaps, which may be a desirable effect, but it runs the risk of divorcing them from the forward momentum of the storytelling (or, to paraphrase, bore them) which is very rarely a screenwriting aim, as far as I know.\r\n\r\n<i>Verse 3</i>\r\n\r\nIn the two structural options given above the adjustments noted here are usually moved to verse 2, but most of the same applies. It\'s time for another verse, but this time we need something different (apart from the lyrics) to represent the arc of the song. Often this will be arrangement, for instance leaving out instruments to give room for dynamic upshifts later, or adding an additional counter-melody to the vocal to colourise it. These two approaches are obvious in our examples - Recovery pulls out every instrument except the acoustic guitar and then builds back in to prepare for the final onslaught; Invisible Touch adds a keyboard counter melody that adds an extra air of mournfulness to the vocal melody, that has continued unchanged from verses one and two. There are a litany of tricks, but you\'ll hear many of them used again and again - a punk band dropping down to just bass and vocals on the second verse for a dynamic change (Green Day, often), a guitar or keyboard line disappearing so as to make a dramatic reappearance.\r\n\r\nOf course sometimes, as noted by both The Ramones and The Violent Femmes, it\'s quite adequate to have \"third verse, same as the first!\".\r\n\r\nThis idea does have a scenic, if not act, parallel in many screenplays, acting as the \'quiet before the storm\'. Before the dramatic upheaval of Act 3, where momentum will become paramount, you can draw together personal and character threads to emphasise theme or arc, so they can be dealt with subtly without affecting the forward motion of the final act. But after that, it\'s time to grab your audience, and, as Radiohead used to say, put your heads down to batter towards the end.\r\n\r\n<i>Chorus 3 (and 4, and etc)</i>\r\n\r\nThe dramatic and final release of tension of the song, and the moment you want to push all of the listeners\' buttons. The tension built up either in verse 3, or in the immediately preceding middle 8 in our other structural option, is detonated in the bit the audience wants to hear. Invisible Touch deftly avoids having to bring the dynamic down in verse 3 (not a good thing to do in a track blatantly designed for radio play) by instead jumping up a key the moment it hits the final chorus (a common trick), with the subconscious realisation in the listener that the same one tone jump for the middle 8 was actually prefiguring this much more important moment. With the extra leeway afforded by a less commercial rock song, Recovery has been able to drop the dynamic down almost to nothing so the final chorus can be for the most part a restatement of previous visits. That said, the tension and release is well handled (sorry if it sounds like I\'m being big headed - it wasn\'t down to me so I\'m kind of talking objectively!) as the vocal rises to a crescendo and the verse extends by one extra bar over normal, with a call back to the drum break that introduced the first verse.\r\n\r\nIn most modern pop and rock songs the final chorus repeats, sometimes one extra repeat, or more. The chorus to fade approach is employed by Invisible Touch, with the vocal melody deviating into one final sing along refrain. Recovery only repeats the sequence of chorus chords once (again with the vocal melody deviating into one final sing along refrain - a familiar songwriting trope) but is still unmistakably there to increase the impact of the last chorus.\r\n\r\nSo here is the short-sharp-shock beat-the-ticking-clock of Act 3, where everything is restated boldly and bombastically, taking all the seeds that have been planted and hopefully encouraging them into a fearsome bloom of colour. The big final action set piece, boy finally gets girl, the mystery is unravelled, or the final epiphany of character. The story / screenplay and song are happily in sync by this point, pandering (for want of a less pejorative word) to the sense of conclusion that most people desire from their popular art.\r\n\r\n<b>Conclusion</b>\r\n\r\n1) I\'m not cut out to be an academic\r\n2) Unless you\'re writing a self-consciously arty screen play with an entirely non-traditional narrative structure, it would be hard to slavishly follow or adapt a traditional pop / rock song form into a workable structure\r\n3) I\'m very traditional, and because people have been pumping movies into my eyes in a three act format since I could see it\'s hard to envisage anything else.</p> ',21),(22,'Hello everyone. Sorry, this blog has been long neglected. My next thing to post was the next chapter of Puritan, but I was waiting until I could get some relevant audio tracks into the computer world, which involved borrowing a DAT machine and finding time between tours to record it and blah blah that\'s my excuse. But I\'ve done it now, so I\'ll get to it soon. But to warm this blog back up, I\'m going to give it over today to a guest spot. A lady called Analisa wrote an email to Frank and the Sleeping Souls, and I thought it was an interesting bit of writing so asked if she would mind me posting it here (since she didn\'t have a blog of her own). She didn\'t, so here it is!\r\n\r\nAnalisa\r\n------------------------\r\n17 April 2014\r\n\r\n<b>The Fandom Double-Standard</b>\r\n\r\nEvidence of avid sports fandom is all around us.  Every winter, masses of college football fans whose team has made it to the Rose Bowl descend on Santa Monica and Venice Beach, easily identifiable by their team colors, clearly enjoying the mild Southern California weather during New Year\'s week.  They are welcomed cheerfully by banners and chalked messages on signboards outside businesses around town.  The very first day I ever spent in Europe, I emerged from an Amsterdam metro station to see the streets, restaurants, and hotel balconies crowded with the red-shirted fans of the Dutch Ajax football team and the green-shirted fans of Glasgow\'s Celtic Football Club, many loudly chanting as they passed through the city in anticipation of a UEFA Champions League qualifying match.  At the time, I had no idea who these teams were, but the passion of their supporters certainly grabbed my attention.  Friends of mine often spend entire days tailgating outside of college football gamesâ€”sometimes never even going into the stadiumâ€”because they find fun and a sense of community in the ritual.  Likewise, I know people who make annual \"guys\' weekends\" out of going to Arizona to watch baseball spring training before the real season begins.\r\n \r\nHow many films have been made and consumed by the masses that celebrate the loyalty of sports fans through thick and thin?  And how many people sign up for a waiting list years in advance so that they can get season tickets to see \"their\" team play as many times as possible, and follow their exploits daily via news and social media outlets?  On game days, spectators wear body paint and wacky headwear, the crowd chants in unison, fans jump out of their seats when their side scores, and it\'s not uncommon to see grown men hugging each other joyfully when their team wins, or consoling each other after losses.  This loyalty, on the whole, is admired by many cultures around the worldâ€”after all, the Olympics are never wanting for international visitors.  Our society seems to celebrate this sense of devotion to one\'s teamâ€”whether national, collegiate, or professionalâ€”much more commonly than it deems it curious or excessive.\r\n \r\nAnd there\'s nothing wrong with that.  None of this is written to denigrate sports fans in any way, but to ask why this understanding of fandom (\"fanaticism\" has a negative connotation I prefer to avoid) doesn\'t always extend to the sphere of music fansâ€”or more specifically, to those of us who choose to attend multiple consecutive shows by our favorite musical artists.  It seems to me that, when a person past their teen years shows a similar level of enthusiasm for a certain performer as a serious sports fan shows for their teamâ€”that is, traveling long distances to see that artist perform repeatedlyâ€”the reaction is more often one of surprise, and sometimes even derision.   Just a sampling: \"She\'s, like, <i>obsessed</i> with them\" or \"You\'re going to Arizona to see Frank Turner?  Are you a <i>groupie?</i>\"  I mean, when was the last time you heard a super-fan of Manchester United or the Green Bay Packers called a groupie or a stalker for going to multiple games of their favorite team?  I\'d be willing to bet that most diehard fans of professional sports teams have never met a single member of their favorite team in person, and probably never will.  On the other hand, now that I\'ve hit my thirties, the bands that I pay to go see repeatedly are generally ones in which at least one member is an acquaintance or friend of mine.    \r\n \r\nHaving been on the receiving end of a few of these negatively tinged comments, I can\'t help but wonder if there is a gender element at play here.  Do male fans get the same reaction when they follow all-male bands from gig to gig?  Or is it just because Frank Turner is male, generally regarded as attractive, and I\'m a single female?  It\'s especially frustrating to be lumped in with the delusional \"Frank, have my babies\" Instagram commenters when I have zero desire to sleep with Frank Turner or any of the members of his band.  I\'m sorry to defy your <i>Almost Famous</i> imaginings, but I\'m not a (wink wink) \"band aide.\"\r\n \r\nSo why the negative judgments?  While spending five nights out of town in pursuit of live music is admittedly a first-world luxury, which I don\'t take for granted, I\'m not endangering my own finances by doing this.  We stay in cheap motels and I\'ve never missed more than one day of work as a result.  (It\'s spring break at the moment, so that helps of course.)  I\'m not neglecting any husband or children, and I\'m not drinking or drugging myself into a stupor every night.  So who\'s to say that this is a \"crazier\" way of spending my leisure time than those diehard sports fans (including some of my own friends and family) that choose to travel long distances to witness \"their\" team play in the World Cup or the Super Bowl?\r\n \r\nBut this still leaves the question that I know some of you have: \"So why does Frank Turner mean so much to you?\"  Where to start?  Well, first of all, it\'s not just Frankâ€”Ben, Nigel, Matt, and Tarrant are key parts of the equation here, and should be given their due as well.  I love their songs (words and music), their welcoming attitudes, the passion they put into their playing, and even their onstage banter.  As of tomorrow, I will have seen Frank play solo, or with the Sleeping Souls, 17 times in four years.  Every time, these shows are among the highlights of my yearâ€”they always have great, handpicked opening acts, they play their hearts out, they make us laugh, and without fail, audience participation is through the roof.  (Side note: I\'m willing to admit that there may be a bit of subconscious bias here, too, because, they collectively represent London and Oxford, two of my very favorite places in the world.)  When I am up front singing along during one of their shows, I feel a comparable sense of communion with those around me that I imagine devout sports fans feel when they\'re packed into a stadium watching a game as one.  For me, few things in life beat those moments in \"Four Simple Words\" when Nigel\'s rapid-fire drum tattoo leads into Frank and the rest of the band joining in for, \"Hi ho hi ho hi ho, we\'re heading out to the punk rock show!\" Almost magically, the building potential energy converts the pit into an absolute explosion of human kinetic energy and, for the moment, nothing else matters.  I\'m not exaggerating when I say that a Frank Turner show is one of the few places where I can forget for a while about all the disquieting thoughts buzzing around inside my head and just get lost in the music and momentum.\r\n \r\nHowever, there is still more to my answer to the question \"Why them?\"  In addition to the amazing live performances, what I appreciate just as much about Frank and the Sleeping Souls is that they have always struck me as humble guys who treat their fans like equals.  Frank has repeatedly stated from onstage that they don\'t want their shows to be about belonging to some secret club for the \"cool people\".  In his own words, \"We didn\'t just come here tonight to shout at each other and then just go home againâ€¦ We\'reâ€¦individuals with different ideas and hopes and dreams and fears, and we all came here with our different baggage, but we left that baggage and those differences at the fucking door.  And tonightâ€¦for just a few hours, we are friends and we are equals, and we have no barrier and no stage and, together, we are more than the sum of our parts.\"  Case in point: He and the band members make a point to chat with people, sign autographs, and pose for countless photos after shows.  Frank regularly responds to questions posed to him through his website, and personally replies to people who have emailed him through the address he shares publicly.  I know that all this may eventually become impossible as their popularity growsâ€”informal meet-and-greets are already a tricky undertaking in their native UK, and Frank spends hours weekly responding to fans\' emailsâ€”but, for as long as it lasts, I appreciate the chance for a hug and a hello after gigs here.  It\'s nice to be remembered.\r\n \r\nAs for the friends I call my \"FT Family\", they are an incredibly welcoming bunch of music lovers who have made me even more intent on seeing Frank perform as often as I can.  Last fall, having never met me in person, they invited me to stay with them when I wanted to go to Frank and the Sleeping Souls\' Las Vegas show, but didn\'t have anyone willing to travel with me from LA.  The core members of this merry crew regularly travel from Salt Lake City to various other cities, making new friends everywhere they go.  Without fail, my cheeks end up hurting from laughter whenever I\'m with themâ€”they can make anything from weeknight karaoke at a bowling alley to awkward encounters with the dinner \"entertainment\" at a Palm Springs steakhouse into absolutely cherished memories.  I can say without a doubt that I would not have spent the time and money I did to try to get a last-minute ticket to this year\'s Coachella Festival if they were not going to be here to experience it with me.  I\'m not going to Coachella just to go to Coachella (as more people than ever seem to be doing these days), and I\'m not even going to Coachella just to see Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls.  I made this effort so that I can see Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls (and some other bands) with these friendsâ€”because <i>they get it</i>.\r\n \r\nPerhaps if I had been born in a different time and place, and had the means to do so, I would have followed around the Beatles, The Clash, or Nirvana.  As it is, I had the unexpected good luck of seeing Frank Turner perform solo in 2010, and feel fortunate to be alive at the right time to continue to see him and his band perform live for what I hope turns out to be a long time.  This man\'s words speak to me more than most of the famous poets I studied through four years of an English degree, and most of the writers I\'ve read since then.  There is a reason I have Frank\'s lyrics \"I still believe in the need for guitars and drums and desperate poetry\" tattooed on my skin. \r\n \r\nThis is my team.  These are my people.\r\n \r\n<i>\"â€¦We\'re headed out to the punk rock show/Colleagues and friends condescend with a smile/But this is my culture, man/This is my home.\"</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThanks Analisa! As for me, I promise that I\'ll try and be back with another blog of my own soon. Bye!',22),(23,'Sorry it\'s been so long since the last time I blogged here. I have been busy, that much is true, but it would be a lie to pretend that was entirely the reason. Many days I wonder the worth of adding to the ever-growing mountain of unsolicited writing out there, of considering my thoughts valuable enough for dissemination. But hey - clearly my ego has won out, because here we are back again!\r\n\r\nThere\'s another chapter of Puritan to come, but I\'m going to do something else this time, kind of like a DVD commentary. I got a couple of old Hi8 videos of lighting gigs I did digitised and have watched them back. I thought it might be interesting if I laid out my thoughts on one of the shows as I watch it back. Being a non-drinker I can remember pretty much every creative impulse, problem and issue I had, so it might be an insight into how a light show is put together, or at least how I do it. Here\'s the video:\r\n\r\n<a href = \"http://youtu.be/bvMFW7ForqM\" target = \"_blank\">YouTube link, if embed doesn\'t work for you</a>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bvMFW7ForqM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1993 I had already been Radiohead\'s LD for over a year. With the success of Creep they were embarking on a tour of US theatres (or \"theaters\", for those with spelling trouble), but to ensure a good turn out they arranged it as a co-headline with Belly, who had also had a big \'ol early 90s indie MTV hit with Feed The Tree. Belly didn\'t have an LD at the time, so I was recommended, I think mostly as an economic thing - share the cost of one LD, rather than hire two.\r\n\r\nThere was only one band\'s worth of budget for the show, but I wanted to make sure there was a distinct visual difference between the two bands. I think the solution was quite elegant and simple. Broad strokes: Radiohead - black backdrop, upstage (at the back) lights rigged on a horizontal truss, downstage (take a wild guess) on vertical trusses, deeply saturated rich colours, PAR cans (the lights themselves) with narrow beams creating pools of darkness between focus points; Belly - white backdrop (called a cyc), upstage lights vertical, downstage horizontal, a more pastel colour palette, wide beam bulbs creating a fuller, friendlier, poppier visual. Shared between both were a smattering of moving lights which, while not in their infancy exactly, were still expensive enough to be much rarer on tours than their punishing ubiquity nowadays would suggest.\r\n\r\nSo, on to the show. I\'ll use the excellently old school time stamp I left on on the camera to reference things. I\'m also going to use a bit of jargon here and there that you may have to google, and I\'ll reference lighting colours by number (old school, gels in front of PAR cans stuff) - you can find guides to what the numbers mean here\r\n<a href = \"http://www.leefilters.com/lighting/colour-list.html\" target = \"_blank\">Lee Filters Catalogue</a>\r\nand here\r\n<a href = \"http://www.rosco.com/filters/supergel.cfm?sortOrder=no&displayType=0#colors\" target = \"_blank\">Rosco Colours</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Someone To Die For</b>\r\n<i>22:03:42</i>\r\nOpen with the cyc lit to immediately set it apart from Radiohead\'s show. I\'m pretty sure I always had the show starting this way, but then I left the cyc for quite a few songs, so I could reintroduce it later, for dynamics. In discussion with the band after production rehearsals they (particularly the drummer Chris, who was very vocal about his ideas) requested a bit more action on it throughout. They were right.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t quite come over on video, but I inadvertently stumbled on a nice effect in this song. The cyc is lit in Lee 139, a very rich green, and Tanya is in mauve, Lee 126. The extreme contrast between these two colours meant that, when viewed from the front, Tanya appeared completely detached from the background, as if she\'d been blue-screened into the scene. \r\n\r\nApart from that, nothing to do in this song. One beautiful scene is plenty\r\n\r\n<b>Angel</b>\r\n<i>22:06:08</i>\r\nHold on the backlight to build tension until the band actually explodes. Play with expectation - the audience wants to see the band, but you can tease them with the shadows. First view of the bright vertical lights from the back, follow the dynamic and motion of the song. I also like to use the minimum number of cues (groups of lights together) for each song, so there\'s a visual tag for people to hang their memories of the each song on.\r\n\r\nFor desks on this tour I was using a Celco (lovely old English lighting desk company, now defunct as far as I know) Pathfinder MIDI\'d to a Navigator. It was less than ideal. There was a lag in the MIDI transmission that meant I had to preempt certain cues to get them to land on time with the music, and the lack of channels meant I was running my cyc lights off the last few LTP channels of the Pathfinder (look it up!). It led to some interesting effects I wouldn\'t have otherwise got, but most of the time it was a pain in the arse.\r\n\r\nUsed a Radiohead downstage wash as between songs, to keep it distinct from the songs themselves. Lee 181 is about my favourite colour ever, but it is very dark, so on this tour, where the number of lights was limited, I substituted it for Rosco 56, which had the same colour properties but was still bright enough to cover a theatre stage with only 8 cans.\r\n\r\n<b>White Belly</b>\r\n<i>22:09:34</i>\r\nNow some of this is going to seem big-headed, but hey, I\'m proud of some stuff that I\'ve done. I really love the way the Intellabeams move in the riff of this song. I have always hated (and still do) watching lighting where it looks like someone is just running the lights through what they *can* do (which nowadays is bloody anything you can imagine), rather than trying to create a visual representation of the song. A couple of times on this show (this song, and Ripcord in the Radiohead set) I feel I got a movement which fitted the musical moment so perfectly that they strode confidently in sync together up the aisle, unhesitatingly grabbed exactly the Pot Noodle they desired (no doubt the brown flavour) and immediately headed to the counter WITH EXACTLY THE CORRECT MONEY IN HAND. \r\n\r\nThe rest of this song was throwing together some nice looking combinations which I didn\'t use on any other song. Having kept Angel mostly binary (a red cue, followed by a blue one), here\'s a combination - Tanya and the drummer in red, and guitarist Tom and mentally bouncy bassist Gail in blue. Holding back the other colours in my arsenal for later on.\r\n\r\nOoh! Look! 22:10:17, it\'s the first entry of Belly\'s backline tech and stage manager. I regret I\'ve forgotten his name, but both him and his tech buddy on stage left were inordinately fond of trotting around the stage during the show, very different to the almost invisible Radiohead crew. Look out for them!\r\n\r\nVerse 2 22:10:52, first moment for a bit of Intellabeam on the cyc. Plenty more of that to come.\r\n\r\n22:11:26 the nice pastel pink makes its first appearance. Can\'t remember the gel number. Sorry. But another thing to notice, that gets thought about less nowadays, is the way the lights are focused to create movement as you swap between cues. The pink cue has a very pronounced cross (Tom and Gail are lit from the opposite side of the stage to where they stand), whereas the blue has a smaller cross. The red and blue has a more pronounced no cross / cross look that emphasises the change.\r\n\r\nI also really enjoyed performing it all, every cue on a fader, and as trained by the wonderful Andi Watson always using fingers on faders rather than buttons, so you can control the fade in and fade out musically, instead of it just being ON! or OFF! Many LDs today use cue stacks - a preprogrammed list of cues that happen one after another when \'GO\' is pressed. For very complex cues there\'s often no other way of doing it, but the interaction of it was always important for me, for my pleasure and for the musicality. The end of the \'white belly up in the sun\' middle 8 I\'m following the drums with the upstage lights and gently following the guitar with the downstage cans, which requires dexterity, almost no-one in the audience would ever notice, but as always I hope that there is a subconscious heightening of the effect of the music, by a notch.\r\n\r\nFor the playout, combine the Intellabeam move with other cues. Still keeping the list of cues for a song short, but climaxing the dynamic by bringing them together in concert. And a classic swing up over the audience to end!\r\n\r\n<b>Sexy Sadie</b>\r\n<i>22:13:23</i>\r\n\r\nHaha. Did I mention Andi Watson earlier? Because I\'m not a man ever shy about trying to emulate other work. I love his lighting. I had a video of the Cure\'s Disintegration tour that he operated Varilites on, and this is one of his cues that I have forever been trying to copy, but never managed. For A Forest, he used the Varilites in blue, changing colour to red. To do this the wheel had to go past white for an instant (so BLUE - FLASH! - RED), and the effect was incredible. It made Robert Smith look like he was jumping microscopically forwards and backwards, because of the way the eye works with deeply saturated blues and reds, and when for the latter part of the song it was blue on the right, red on the left, then SWAP, it was one of the greatest lighting cues known to man. That\'s what I was trying to do here, but Intellabeams just don\'t cut it - no white in between the red and blue, and they don\'t change colour fast enough for the visual effect to happen.\r\n\r\n22:13:43 - stage manager!\r\n\r\nPink and amber in the choruses, for the bigness. First entry for the whole amber cue, and I know think I\'ve just about used up everything that the audience might not have seen. One of those times though where I didn\'t need to do so much I think. I could have just stuck with those two cues for the whole of the multi-part chorus. I was young. Naive. Excitable. A little immature.\r\n\r\nGuitar solo - a little chase (a sequence of cues played back automatically by the desk). Often I did chases myself with the dextrous fingers, but occasionally for aggressive speed technology does it better.\r\n\r\nNot the best track. A little uninspired. But got to do something! Can\'t just leave them in the dark.\r\n\r\n<b>Full Moon, Empty Heart</b>\r\n<i>22:17:39</i>\r\n\r\nClearly haven\'t used up everything, here\'s a couple of new gags. A Thomas 8-lite behind the drummer (gelled in Lee 201, to match it with the white from the Intellabeam lighting Tanya), and a leko at the base of each \'Radiohead\' downstage truss with a breakup gobo in. Moody intro, gently pushing a touch of movement with fades following the vocal. I love darkness. I\'m not afraid of everything going nearly black, so that you can have more effect when you make it light again.\r\n\r\n<b>Star</b>\r\n<i>22:21:05</i>\r\n\r\nNow, being English I don\'t like things being too literal. I think it was Chris\'s suggestion to project stars on the backdrop for this song. I probably would have rejected it as too cheesy, but it works (thanks Chris!), so mostly I ended up just playing with different colours and stuff on the cyc. Cues are the old classic front blue & back red / front red & back blue combos. Made a bit of use of the split cyc channels for the dancing colours.\r\n\r\n22:24:02 Whoops! Shouldn\'t have leant on that in between songs. As you were. Ignore the enormous blue green cyc. Carry on.\r\n\r\n<b>Dream On Me</b>\r\n<i>22:24:13</i>\r\n\r\nI distinctly remember not really having an idea of what to do for this song. Mostly I\'d listen to something and it would provoke some kind of image in my mind. But not this one. So it\'s not very inspired, just doing *something*. A gobo on the cyc. A bit of truss warming (lighting up the trusses that the lights are hung on) from the I-beams. Creating limits for myself - only lights from the outer of the vertical bars for the verses for instance. Looks OK, but it\'s always troubled me. And I don\'t like the way the downstage pinks get onto the cyc too much.\r\n\r\n<b>Low Red Moon</b>\r\n<i>22:30:12</i>\r\n\r\nMy undoubted favourite of the Belly set. This was one where I saw it pretty much as is in my head when I heard the song first time, and managed to make the lighting rig comply. It sounded like fire in the night (yes yes, I\'m getting a bit poncey), so I held back the deep red (Rosco 27) cyc for this song, with tight yellow I-beams scanning around the stage, and the floor I-beams providing the pulse. Still gives me a bit of a horn now. To me, it looks like it sounds. Then the verses are moody and dark (with a bit of a nod to parts of Home By The Sea from Genesis\' Mama Tour video). For a few shows we had a PAR on the floor in front of Tanya in red as well that made her look positively demonic when the yellow lights centered on her from behind, but I think we\'d dropped that for technical reasons by this point.\r\n\r\nThose damn strobes (High End Dataflash, with a controller) never did what I wanted them to for the entire tour. Always twitchy. This is their first dramatic entry into the Belly set though. Hopefully they\'d been absent long enough for people to forget about them being in the Radiohead set.\r\n\r\nIt was unbelievably difficult to get lights to gently scan around the stage with the desks I had. Modern desks make it so simple it\'s untrue. Lucky kids today, don\'t know they\'re born, etc. etc.\r\n\r\n<b>Feed The Tree</b>\r\n<i>22:37:45</i>\r\n\r\nLast gag! Floral gobos projected onto the cyc from a couple of lekos on the front truss. Tree - geddit? Tried for the mexican wave effect (love it on Los Endos from The Invisible Touch Tour DVD), but it wasn\'t very effective on a tiny number of moving mirror fixtures, plus the fact that on the last night of the tour the smoke machines had run out of fluid, so the beams were invisible. Ho hum. I did have a tendency to use a touch too much smoke (this was before I had access to more effective haze), but this is too little. Then tried another Disintegration gag of the bar gobos sweeping left to right that also didn\'t cut the mustard. Still, the 126 cue looks nice.\r\n\r\n<b>Gepetto</b>\r\n<i>22:41:38</i>\r\n\r\nAlways saw a ceiling of changing light when I heard the riff to this song. So wallop! there it is. Playing havoc with the camera\'s autofocus. Thinking shapes on the back PARs - pairs of lights together. That blue and amber combo from the downstage truss looks pretty sexy of Tanya and Gail. We\'re getting towards the end, and it\'s a single, so let\'s throw more shit in! Bigger! Better! Faster! More! Classic audience sweep to finish!\r\n\r\n<b>Are You Experienced</b>\r\n<i>22:45:07</i>\r\n\r\nLike the I-beam colour combo (pink and light blue). Saved up the open white (well, Lee 201 for a less yellow white) cyc for this back end of the set. Going for shapes rather than particular colours on the upstage PARs (climbing straight up the bars). And another movement that I\'m well proud of for the drum break at the end of the guitar solo (despite the audio wobble on the ancient tape just at that moment) - the lights look like they\'re \'doing\' the music.\r\n\r\n<b>Slow Dog</b>\r\n<i>22:50:05</i>\r\n\r\nEnd of the set, abandon subtlety! Those moving lights scanning over the crowd - 25 seconds work on a modern desk, maybe 10 minutes every day back in 1993. I\'m not a fan of lights just wobbling all over the place for no apparent musical reason, but it seems to do good things for the end of gig energy, so, OK. Loads of sweeping here and there for lights - look what we\'ve spent! Super bright everything white chorus (with the not very under control strobes helping, but not much), but I really like the way it tightens up and goes mauve - if you look you can see the iris on the I-beam open up a little as each light changes back to white, making the stage open up over the course of those two bars. More effective with smoke again. My lighting crew chief was very embarrassed about that.\r\n\r\nBridge looks a little like the mysterons from Captain Scarlet. And how do you end? Audience sweep! Leave the cyc lit to nail that \'Belly\' look into the audiences eyes while they\'re waiting for the encore.\r\n\r\n<b>Untogether</b>\r\n<i>22:55:53</i>\r\n\r\nTanya and Thom did this as a duet for the whole tour. It was not universally loved by the crew (speaking just for myself I found it mawkish and oversentimental), so for this last show of the tour we pranked it. There was a large plastic goose backstage at the theatre (no, I\'ve no idea why), so we rigged it up on a pulley so it could majestically descend while Thom and Tanya were serenading each other. It was a source of great joy for me to be on my intercom saying \"stand by goose... go goose\" to the stage crew. Then, to make the point, all of the I-beams moved in to light it up. And just at that, very appropriate point the tape ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you made it this far, you\'re either some kind of boredom masochist or actually interested in lights and the tedious way my mind works. Either way - thanks for reading! I *promise* there\'ll be another Puritan chapter coming up.',23),(24,'<strong>1989 - 1992: Once Around The Park</strong>\n\nMy dad, still with his eye on solid academic achievement, insisted that I at least consider university. Out of respect I applied for places on a number of courses, but the interview process was somewhat unusual, since the hardening of my ambition to be somehow involved with music had meant that the only courses I could conscience would be musical. However, if you flick back a few pages you\'ll find that I had no formal musical qualifications, outside of a grade 2 piano exam, having done \'A\' levels in physics, maths and chemistry. I went for interviews at Liverpool, Salford, Brighton and some other place up north that escapes me now, and the conversations were similar throughout:\n\"So, you are applying to do music at degree level here\"\n\"Yep\"\n\"And you have \'A\' levels in three totally musically unrelated subjects\"\n\"Yep\"\n\"Hmmm\"\n\nDespite this I must have somehow impressed at interview (or the courses were woefully under-subscribed) because I was offered places at Liverpool, Brighton and the other place up north that escapes me now. The only one that didn\'t offer me a place, which still rankles a little, was Salford. It rankles, and I found and still find it ironic, because of all of them it was the only rock / pop music themed course, and one that I would contend I have proven myself to be most suited to. Stupid pride I know, because I didn\'t really have any intention of taking up the place, but I do recall they asked for auditions on your first and second instrument. God knows why, but rather than say keyboards was my second instrument I opted for bass, which I had enthusiastically taken up a few years before by working my way through the Level 42 back catalogue as a way of teaching myself. The walk from Salford station to the college was along an exposed road that had what appeared to be a force 7 gale blowing at right angles across it; this was somewhat uncomfortable when carrying Rik\'s bass (that I had borrowed for the occasion) with it\'s big rectangular case acting as a sail who\'s only purpose was to try and break my wrist repeatedly. And then they didn\'t even test me on any bass playing, the bastards, so I carried it back down that same street and home again.\n\nI was coached through my Brighton interview, which was for a course that was apparently well-regarded and much more \'straight\' music, by Jonny Greenwood, who was well-versed in all of the academic musical strictures. I particularly remember that he gave me a swift primer on harmonising a tune, and exactly that came up in the interview. I still use the advice he gave me in that 60 minutes when arranging string parts now.\n\nBut really I felt I was interviewing them more than they were interviewing me. I knew what I wanted to do, and had a good idea of many ways of doing it. I wanted to know if they had anything that they or their course could offer. The place up north whose name escapes me now was OK, but the campus was miles from a major city and would provide little opportunity for gigging and gigging and networking and more gigging, so I counted that out. The guy who interviewed me at Brighton was inspirational and suited me well, and that would have been a great option if the course hadn\'t been quite so scarily \'real\' music. Liverpool seemed the best option - good facilities including a recording studio, a course representative who seemed to have his head on his shoulders (less cool than the Brighton guy, much less of a twonk than the Salford guy) and a mile or so out of the city centre of a vibrant musical city. So Liverpool it was.\n\nOr rather wasn\'t. I accepted the place, and then a couple of weeks later phoned up to defer for the following year, which happened without incident. Many friends were doing the same, intending to head off around the world / the U.S. / Asia / Australia for their gap year, but I could so not see even the remotest whimper of an iota of a scintilla of a point in that. Spend money? For no return? Eh? I couldn\'t fit a drumkit in a backpack, so there was really no question.\n\nMy brother\'s girlfriend at the time, a lovely lady called Abigail, had done some summer work at an archeological bookseller called Oxbow Books, and through her I got a job as their despatch manager (manager? ha! I packed up books and sent them to people who\'d ordered them, as well as pootling around Oxford in a tiny little van to deliver local orders). I started in September 1989, a couple of moths after finishing school. I was also desperate for a vehicle of my own so, bless my middle-classness, the parents got me a van for my birthday that year. I do believe I chipped in some of my savings that had come from various Aunts and Uncles over the years to help buy it, but I had specifically requested the Mitsubishi L300 van because that\'s what Roger Nunn drove, and he was a drummer and had hair like Limahl and that\'s what we all wanted back then. It was nicknamed \'The Gubb\' for reasons that escape me.\n\nWith this in place I embarked on a whole load of new musical adventures. Illiterate Hands sputtered out, sadly. Matt the guitarist was a bit of a handful, so we had done one final gig right at the end of my school career, which I had co-organised in the sports hall of the local college of further education. It was a fun show, but the most notable point was one of the support bands was called The Purple Rhinos, which had emerged out of Skag And The Gynecologists when Alan had been replaced by a different bass player called Jason Moulster, or Jase to his friends. I clearly remember Jonny and I stood beside the stage watching this guy play with jaws agape - he was a totally amazing bassist, good looking, a lovely fella (we\'d find later) and pissed as a fart. After this final gig Illiterate Hands did have a smattering of rehearsals as a four piece, with Andy taking his first tentative steps playing acoustic guitar, and there were two songs that I still remember as catchy, wildly off-kilter acoustic indie things that sounded entirely unlike anything else. Somehow though with the end of school we couldn\'t keep any momentum going, and without any drama whatsoever it quietly faded out.\n\nKiss The Dirt were also still a going concern, still with Roger on drums and me on keyboards, with Betsy having been replaced by Beadie Finzi, the \'very cool singer-guitarist\' with whom I had had a semi-relationship back in chapter 3, or 1987 depending on your perspective. We played a few gigs and I wore many hats. Not figuratively, actual hats. The keyboard parts were usually sparse and not too challenging, quite often being triggering samples at the right time, so rather than stand around looking like an embarrassed numpty while not playing for the first time I developed a stage persona, one that could loosely be defined as \'dickhead\'. I had an enormous pile of headgear that I would bring onstage with me, changing multiple times throughout the set, and loon about whenever not tied to the keyboards - stupid dancing, attempting to hurt myself however possible, and in one case scaling a quite enormous lighting rig. I was still the same shy and slightly uncomfortable person I\'d always been but, in keeping with my personality, there was a job that needed doing (in this case PERFORMING) so there was no question that I was going to do it.\n\nI think I had also been slightly affected in this attitude by certain gigs I had seen, one a how to (kind of) and the other a how not to. Jesus Jones were one of my favourite bands of the time, a very exciting (or so I thought back then) melding of techno and rock that no-one else was doing, and their keyboard player was a total nutter, hurling his instrument around the stage while he played, heaving it over his head, anything to put on a goddamn show. I was also a big fan of Tanita Tikarem\'s first album, which I played over and over. Until that is she came to play at Oxford Apollo and I went to see it. It remains, bar none, the most boring live show I\'ve ever seen. They came on, played songs off the album that sounded just like the album, and went off again. No-one moved. They didn\'t bring their own lighting rig. She mumbled to the crowd in that faux-folk humility that completely fails to ignite anything. And it made me want, deep down in my soul, to make sure I was never, ever that dull live, even if it went against all my personal instincts for down-beatness or made me look like a total dick. Better that than boring.\n\nIn fact, to pick up a thread from that last paragraph, lighting had become the second of the twin peaks of my life\'s passions. Iron Maiden had always had an eye for a terrific live show, and their Live After Death video had been a fixture on our VHS for some years. Vastly more influential than that on me though was Genesis. I burned through two copies of their Mama tour film from the NEC in Birmingham in 1983 because I loved the music and the performance, but I loved the incredible, scintillating, beautiful lighting just as much. I would still count it as one of the greatest pure lighting shows (as opposed to theatrical shows or shows that integrate video and other media) ever, with moments as elegant as a watercolour, aggressive as a fist fight and, in the middle of In The Cage, simply inspirationally eye-popping - that one moment, along with when the mellotron choir first comes in on the Seconds Out version of Cinema Show, became one of the things I felt my life was dedicating to reproducing, trying to put across that feeling in something that I do.\n\nBut for now drumming, my other passion, was in the driving seat. I was playing with a heavy metal band, who I don\'t think ever had a name, led by local P.A. builder Dee Kallie (that\'s a bloke by the way), alongside American singer Leslie Orinick, who I would later help out on a solo demo by playing drums, keyboards and bass.<!--{a::1::n}--> I played a couple of gigs with People Like Us, one of the school bands who had managed to continue after \'graduation\', and drummed with a handful of other acts who needed a percussionist. And, at Dee\'s house, I recorded a lengthy demo for The Purple Rhinos, who I had been driving around in my van as a roadie for some time, and who had acquired a new singer, in the shape of Anita Wilson.\n\nNot long after this their drummer Dan decided to head out to Australia for a lengthy \'gap year\' visit, and they asked if I would step in temporarily so they could keep playing while he was gone, which I happily agreed to. After one rehearsal with two drummers in Dan\'s garage where I Iearned all the songs we were out and playing shows locally.\n\nEven though it was me and Jim the guitarist who had been at school together, him a year above me, it was with Jason that I developed a swift and deep rapport. I guess that is often the way between drummers and bass players, the rhythmic engine room of any band, but it was also helped by Jase being the nicest possible guy in the world ever. Ever. <!--{b::1::r}-->\n\nThe band was also built around a social group who hung out together in an Abingdon pub. I enjoyed the company and counted all of them among my friends, but I remained a step leftwards of everybody, as only a teetotaller in a pub can. While everyone else would finish the night knocking back brewskis (does anyone actually say that?) around someone\'s house I would often duck out early.\n\nThe Purple Rhinos rapidly became an outfit with a propensity for gigging often and anywhere, and one that I was very committed to. As the time of Dan\'s return approached Jase became quite adamant that he wanted to continue playing with me. Jim, having played with Dan since Skag And The Gynecologists at school was much more conflicted, but ultimately was in agreement with Jase. I don\'t remember if Anita had a particular opinion about the whole deal, but then she was a bit of a dappy moo.<!--{b::2::l}-->\n\nDan returned and was given his marching orders by Jim. This turned out to be somewhat more physically dangerous than anyone had anticipated. Dan\'s closest friend in the social group we were part of was called Garwor, a fella who was as wide as three of me and a black belt in karate. After a show in Oxford he appeared to pursue Jason and Jim down the street and give them a (gentle, thankfully) kicking outside the cinema for driving a stake through the heart of the group, as he saw it. It was another important lesson for me however - to do this properly you had to treat it with the dispassion of a professional career, not an opportunity for amplified social interaction. Even though we were a piss-ant band from a market town near Oxford, you still should make decisions that will make the band better, even if it means pissing off your friends or being beaten up by an angry martial artist.\n\nWith the lineup stabilised we upped the pace a little. I was working during the day at Oxbow, rehearsing one or two nights a week with Purple Rhinos<!--{f::1::n}-->, maybe one rehearsal a week with one of the other bands I was in, and at least one gig most weeks, barring the traditional gig dead time of July and August. On A Friday had discovered a village hall in nearby Clifton Hampden who were willing to hire themselves out to noise making bands to rehearse, so the Rhinos traipsed out there as often as we could afford. We picked up and dropped off the key with the strange lady who was guardian of the village hall and apparently some kind of local white witch. <!--{a::2::n}-->\n\nWe booked all the shows ourselves, and being no-one we often had to organise minibuses of our local fans to far flung locations (well, London, Reading and Birmingham) to secure a gig. Heidi, a friend of ours, acted as manager but no-one in our team really had any industry nous, it was all just shooting in the dark. To put in my time of chasing promoters for gigs I had to head down to the nearest phone box with a pile of 10 pence pieces in my lunch breaks. One particular week we had already played the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and I was looking forward to actually going home after work on the Thursday and sleeping for a long time. At this point all of the other <!--{b::3::l}-->members were on the dole and would thus sleep late after gigs, but I was working every day so would find myself somewhat sleep deprived. However Thursday morning someone called from Liverpool University asking what time we\'d be arriving today. We\'d sent them a demo and heard nothing back, but somewhere down the line they\'d offered us a show that we either hadn\'t got the message about or that we\'d forgotten about. Off we headed straight from my work at 4 p.m. (I worked through my lunch hour so we could get away early), got to the gig about 7, and after soundcheck discovered that it was a late student event and that we\'d be playing at 2 a.m. Nice.\n\nWe played, with Jim getting repeated electric shocks off his microphone, and then headed for home, me driving my van and feeling somewhat worse for wear by this point. And since we\'re talking about drinking in this tome, yes, I did always drive, because everyone else always drank. Not that Jim or Anita were capable of operating a vehicle even when perfectly sober. I was so knackered I had to stop for a \'power nap\' at a services on the M6, during which 30 minutes Jim and our lighting guy / roadie / mate Damon managed to win a ton of money on a fruit machine. Back on the road, we hit Oxford at about 7.30 a.m. and I parked the van outside Oxbow books. I crawled in the back for an hour\'s sleep while everyone else headed to McDonalds for a McBreakfast.\n\nI was in and working by 8.30 a.m., but, joy of joys, the boss chose that morning to head off on a business meeting that he wasn\'t due to return from for some hours. I made myself a nest hidden behind various types of large packaging material and curled up for a nap.\n\nI was awoken some hours later by the sound of starlings mating. Or was it police radios? In my addled state of mind I couldn\'t immediately make it out. When the sound receded I crawled out of my corrugated crib to find that while I had been unconscious the estranged husband of one of the ladies who worked across the other side of the warehouse style room (I was visually removed from them by bookshelves, hence being able to nest) had come in, smashed up a filing cabinet and thrown a couple of computers across the room. Holy shit. I had no idea, and felt kind of bad about it, but signally failed to learn any lessons about not mixing work and gigs.\n\nAnother justification for not drinking was crystallising as well. I was working hard at the day job and earning, for a first timer still living at home, a reasonable amount (about Â£110 per week after tax as I recall). It didn\'t escape my notice that everyone else I knew was spending a healthy proportion of their earnings (or dole in the case of my band mates) on drinking. I much preferred keeping hold of it and spending it on musical things - cymbals, microphones, drum skins and sticks, keyboards, compressors, reverbs. It didn\'t even seem like a hard choice to drink water and get better stuff to make music with.\n\nAs the summer of 1990 rolled around I clearly decided that I wasn\'t in enough bands, since when Phil Selway from On A Friday, who had now changed their name to Shindig, headed off to Ireland to woo Cait, his future wife, they asked me to fill in so they could keep playing over the summer, and I enthusiastically agreed. It was another idyllic time for me - I rehearsed regularly with Shindig, Kiss The Dirt and Purple Rhinos, and recorded with all three bands, with some of the Shindig stuff being amongst my proudest work. There weren\'t many gigs, as is traditional with the summer months, but I kept busy with music and packaging archeological texts. Towards the end of the summer, when for a while it looked like Phil might not come back, Thom (as he was now) and the rest of the band floated the idea of me being the drummer full time, and with my rapidly developing ear for a good tune and commercial sense of who was going to be successful I said I\'d probably just stick with Purple Rhinos as my main band. And I think history has proven me to be in the right. Ish.\n\nLots of things happened in September. Phil did come back, and Jonny opted to take up a place at Oxford Poly (now Brookes University) to study music - not the best course that he was offered, but somewhere that would keep him close to the band. Ed, Thom and Colin had just finished University at Manchester, Exeter and Cambridge respectively and returned to Oxford to make a go of music, the band name having now reverted back to On A Friday. Four of them moved into a house together on Ridgefield Road in Oxford, and as they pulled together demos and gigs I stepped in to drive them in my van, and occasionally do live sound ineptly.\n\nI stepped down from Kiss The Dirt and was replaced by a small black box made by Alesis.\n\nWhile I continued working with books Purple Rhinos resumed their intense gigging schedule around the country, and we felt like we were beginning to make headway, with various promoters around the country now counting themselves as fans and putting us on again and again. That kind of support is invaluable to the morale of a rising band - when the road manager (and girlfriend of the lead singer) of New Model Army saw us she was impressed enough to put us on with them in Walsall, which was terrifying (bouncy dayglo guitar pop band playing in front of the hordes of unwashed political activism) but an amazing shot in the arm nonetheless.\n\nAt a show in London in \'91 we managed to secure a distribution deal with Pinnacle, who at the time were amongst the biggest independent distributors in the country. We recorded an EP at Fleece Studios, a relatively expensive 24 track (financed by me and my ascetic ways, of course), and started trying to get everything in place for our first proper release.<!--{a::3::n}-->\n\nAt the same time OAF had attracted the interest of the owners of local studio Courtyard as managers, who in turn had used contacts they had to pull in record company interest. Within a matter of weeks they had every A&R<!--{f::2::n}--> man from the capital heading for a show at the greatest of the small Oxford venues The Jericho Tavern, from which they scored a deal with Parlophone. This could be revisionism, but I\'m sure I had not even the remote st pang of jealousy - Jonny had been one of my three very closest friends (with Andy and Ian Patrick) for such a long time I was nothing but fabulously excited and pleased.\n\nPurple Rhinos fought on, designing the album artwork with the help of some of the people at Oxbow books, and trying to pull together press and pluggers without even knowing who these people were or how to contact them. The only way to learn is to do, and this was frontline, if wildly inept, doing. Money flowed out, and already by that point I could see that even if we sold all 1,000 copies that we were pressing we (I) was going to be out of pocket, but it barely mattered: we were all possessed of the declamatory spirit of the hellfire preacher.\n<!--{b::4::r}-->   \n   \nIn May 1991 OAF renamed themselves Radiohead and released some remixed versions of their demo tapes as their first EP, Drill. I remember sitting on the floor at Ridgefield Road with the rest of the band early in the morning listening to their first Radio One play, on the Gary Davies show. It was the most inane introduction to a record this side of Smashy and Nicey, but the breakthrough was a huge rush of adrenaline, even for people like me who were just friends and volunteer employees. They went out on the road properly for the first time in their VW LT45 van that they had bought with their record advance, and I, while still working at Oxbow and gigging with the Rhinos, started showing up at any of the shows that I could get to, to roadie and do lights. The first show of the tour, and also the first with their new sound man Jim Warren, was at the long gone Barrel Organ in Birmingham. Jim told me later he had spent the night panicking because he couldn\'t find the backing vocals that were floating around quietly, until he realised that it was actually me bellowing along at the lighting desk. As I turned up more often and made myself useful it eventually became an official position, with pay and everything.\n\nThe Purple Rhinos EP fell apart not long after that. Just before a show at The Old Fire Station in Oxford we found out that Pinnacle were pulling out of the deal, citing rapidly declining sales across the board. Shell-shocked, we went on stage and fucked it all up. Jim drank a boat-load, and became my first experience of someone drinking until it impaired their ability to put on a show. Eventually Anita lost patience with the randomness of notes emitting from Jim\'s amp and left the stage mid-song, leaving Jim, Jase and me to soldier through a couple of other tracks with Jim singing. Anita returned so we could kind of finish the show, and we left the stage already fighting, with it becoming full-blown by the time we hit the dressing room (literally hit - a large mirror was destroyed in the ensuing fracas). I could immediately see the end - I think we all could - but no-one wanted to admit it. I could feel the black wave building behind me again.\n\nExerting her gravitational pull, I went down to Bristol to see X at University, appropriately since thoughts of her always seemed to accompany encroaching blackness. I think we were friends enough that me showing up to surprise her was not at all weird. Hope so. We hung out and chatted in her Uni bar (where I incidentally also bumped into Dhili Arulambulem, my friend from around the corner in Bickley who I hadn\'t seen since 1985), and I walked her back to her room and I didn\'t try anything. I think by this point I had met and was going out with the first great love of my life Alice, and while I don\'t recall any unfaithful intentions I couldn\'t resist the lure of the X.\n\nIn summer \'92 Radiohead went to Chipping Norton studios, about a half hour outside of Oxford, to record their proper debut single with a couple of genial American fellows, Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, chosen for their prior work with Pixies and Throwing Muses. As history has well recorded (ha!) the intended lead track was dropped mid-session for a song Thom had been sitting on since university called Creep. I have absolutely no pretense to having the \'golden ears\' of an A&R guy, but it was clearly a magical piece of music. To horrifically mix a metaphor it also started uncovering the molten centre of the slowly growing X cancer - for reasons I can\'t explain the evening that Jonny gave me a cassette of the new song (with it\'s original \'leg of lamb\' second verse lyrics) I ended up sat outside X\'s Abingdon home in my van playing Creep over and over again and crying my eyes out. And she wasn\'t anywhere near there anyway, being as how she was still at university in Bristol!\n\nPurple Rhinos supported Radiohead at the newly-christened Zodiac club in Oxford in June, and quite soon afterwards decided to call it a day. It wasn\'t just feeling winded by the EP falling to bits, it was the beginnings of a rift in musical direction. Jase had started writing expansive and atmospheric pieces of music that had no place in the driving punk pop of the Rhinos, and I was getting interested in pursuing something subtler, perhaps inspired by REM\'s recent and awesome Out Of Time album. We had an urge to not just disappear, so we arranged a final show at The Jericho Tavern, in the usually dead summer months. Perversely we played 4 or 5 new songs at our final show, we sold out the Tavern for the first time, and tears were shed. The band I had put all of my wherewithal into for 3 years (which is a long time at that age) was done. I had no idea exactly what to do, so I thought I would buy myself a little bit of time. I quit Oxbow books, and offered to go out on the road with my friends Radiohead for a couple of months while I figured out my next move. This did not work out quite as planned.',24),(25,'Been concentrating on updating the site to include contact links for hiring me as a session drummer. But over the summer I did a couple of shows with my old pals in the Genesis tribute band <a href = \"http://www.losendos.co.uk/\">Los Endos</a>. Here\'s a couple of drum views of songs from those shows, with some commentary by me below:\r\n\r\n<!--{v::<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/bzEX8NAyeOk?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<strong>Firth Of Fifth</strong>::c}-->\r\n\r\nPlaying with a tribute band is kind of a funny thing. I know that it is retrogressive, but at the same time it is enormous fun recreating challenging music that I was an enormous fan of when young (and to this day). The keyboard solo of this song is a case in point. I consider it an amazing piece of writing. It\'s instantly melodic and recognisable, but when you try and figure out what is going on it\'s mental. I still have no idea what time signature you would write it in. It seems to be a random collection of bars of 8, 9, 11 and 12. This version of it is probably the best I\'ve ever done, particularly the middle section, which always slightly stumps me. And it\'s followed by imho the most beautiful guitar solo ever recorded, so playing behind that is naturally a pleasure.\r\n\r\n<!--{v::<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1hTuWTcy-yY?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<strong>Apocalypse in 9/8 from Supper\'s Ready</strong>::c}-->\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most difficult things I\'ve found to play. Not that it is particularly involved technically, but musically it\'s a mind-bender. The rhythm section is playing a straightforward riff in 9/8 (nine beats in a bar) while the keyboardist ignores all that faff and plays in 4/4. On the album version Phil Collins sticks with the rhythm section (he\'s said in interviews more than once he was baffled by what on earth keyboardist Tony Banks was doing), but in later live versions, once they\'d played it hundreds of times, he started diverting from the 9/8 riff to punctuate and support various parts of the organ solo. Mostly my inspiration for this version was the awe-inspiring Seconds Out version from \'77. I don\'t do it as well as him (of course, given that at that time he was among the very best drummers in the entire known world), but I satisfied myself that I got to within a few short miles of it. Man, it\'s fun to do. And don\'t tell anyone, but I think this is the only time me and Los Endos got it absolutely spot on in all the shows I played with them. ',25),(26,'It\'s been a long time since my last blog. Yeah, sure, I know. Sorry. Just leave it. OK?\r\n\r\nSomething came up yesterday though that seemed worthy of talking about. Apparently it\'s 10 years since Milow\'s album The Bigger Picture was released, and album that I produced and played on. I thought it would be worth talking a bit about how it came about, the process and the aftermath. <!--{b::01::r}-->I was too crazily busy to take any photos of the sessions but I have included some of the photos Jonathan sent me afterwards, some taken by him, some clearly taken by somebody else since he is in them. Sorry I haven\'t credited you, complain vociferously at me via the email address below and I will put this right! Also, some of the dates are a little bit vague. It was a long time ago, after allâ€¦\r\n\r\nIt was sometime in 2005 that I first got an email from Jonathan Vandenbroek, who went under the performing name of Milow. At the time my life was pretty packed: Dive Dive were seriously busy touring the life out of Tilting At Windmills; I was working on my second solo album; I had a day job lecturing on the Music BND at Oxford College; and I think I\'m right in saying I was also the in house lighting engineer at The Zodiac in Oxford in the evenings. Add to that that it wasn\'t the happiest time in my head and perhaps it might not have seemed the best time for him to get in touch, but I do think the old axiom \"if you want something done, give it to a busy person\" holds true - with all that momentum I don\'t recall have too many second thoughts about grabbing onto another new thing.\r\n\r\nHe was a young singer songwriter from Belgium who said he was a big fan of Unbelievable Truth, and particularly Almost Here. He knew I\'d produced it, and wanted to try and capture some of the same spirit for his music, so wondered if I would consider getting involved in producing his material.\r\n\r\nNow I\'ll admit privately I wasn\'t very confident about it. I had been immensely proud of Almost Here, but the second Unbelievable Truth album sorrythankyou had suffered from a claustrophobic and congested production (I helmed that record also) which I was disappointed by, and my debut solo album miseryguts had also reflected the sound inside my head at the time into the outside world, to its detriment. I had done little bits and pieces of producing other people but not enough to fully get my mojo back. But I swallowed all of that down. Nothing ventured nothing gained, and you never improve by hiding and being afraid, so I answered positively. It was helped by the fact that Jonathan was articulate, serious, thoughtful and clearly ambitious.\r\n\r\nHe sent me over a collection of acoustic demos of his songs. His voice was clearly superb and some of the songs were immediate grabbers. We traded some ideas across email and the internet, but I knew, and said to him, that things would go quicker face to face. Immediately - and this was a measure of his get-it-done personality - immediately he suggested a date and booked a ticket on the Eurostar from Brussels to London, and then a train onwards to Oxford.\r\n\r\nAt the time I wasn\'t entirely clear how he was being funded. I didn\'t want to undersell myself, especially since he might have been being bankrolled by a label, so I was charging for my day. I picked him up from the station and we headed to my flat in the centre of Abingdon, and I quickly gathered that his ambition extended to totally funding everything himself out of his own pocket. This focussed my mind excellently.\r\n\r\n<!--{b::2::l}-->We had chosen the song More Familiar to work on, and his visit was supposed to just be a writing session. But given that he\'d come all that way, and that now I understood he was on the line for everything he was doing, I suggested we just went ahead and recorded it. We did it all upstairs in my flat. I suggested spacing out the verses a little bit with some piano - if memory serves the finger picking pattern continued all the way through verse and chorus originally - to give it an organic dynamic lift into the chorus, and we fiddled slightly with the structure, but there was no major surgery necessary or desired - Jonathan was already well in control of his craft. I grabbed a tiny kit from my garage and laid down a rhythm track with brushes (we were in a flat surrounded by other people so a full loud drum part wasn\'t possible, but thankfully necessity and art were happy bedfellows in this case). Jonathan played in the guitar, I added piano, bass and organ before Jonathan did his lead vocal and we were done in a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nHe released it to no great fanfare at home, but it did open a few doors as I understood it, getting a smattering of radio play and a few positive reviews.  In my self-deprecating way I imagined that that might be the end of our relationship - it hadn\'t set the world alight so an ambitious fellow like him would probably look elsewhere. But he emailed again to start a discussion about making an album. And I\'m going to use this forum to once again apologise to him - when we were starting to work on it he made another trip out to see me in Abingdon. While he was en route my 4 year old daughter had a small but nasty accident that required surgery, so upon emerging from the Tunnel Sous La Manche he had a message from me apologising profusely, but telling him to turn around and go home again because I was going to be at the hospital with her all day and night. I didn\'t think twice about the decision, but it did butt up against my sense of professionalism most uncomfortably.\r\n\r\nHe clearly wanted his album made properly, and my suggestion was that, rather than fudge stuff together in bedrooms using my ProTools LE rig, if he could stretch to a week in a proper studio we could go like the clappers and have something proper by the end of it. We could save money by me covering most of the instruments so we didn\'t need to pay lots of external musicians, and I would also get the mix done in the studio week. He found <!--{b::3::l}-->Motormusic studio in Belgium who he managed to talk into a deal on a week of studio time at the end of August 2005, so I loaded my car to the absolute brim with everything I thought I might need and headed out there.\r\n\r\nI arrived about lunchtime after driving and ferrying for 8 hours, so we had some lunch before getting into it. I was trying to make my best impression with Jonathan, the charismatic owner of the studio and the in-house engineer who we would be working with for the recording. I made myself a ham sandwich while attempting to turn on the charm. <!--{b::4::r}-->The charm was made challenging however by the sandwich itself. The proximity of Belgium to France had led me to inwardly assume that their mustard would be similar (tangy, but not like the full on face-assault that is English mustard), so I had liberally applied swathes to my sandwich. Upon the first bite however it was clear that Belgians like their mustard much more similar to the English â€˜punishing decongestant\' style, but because I didn\'t want to ruin the charm offensive by spitting out a half chewed pellet of bread and meat I just kept chewing, and continued - painfully - through the entire rest of the sandwich. I don\'t *think* they noticed, but I\'m sure there must have been some wondering why my eyes were glassy with tears at that early stage.\r\n<!--{b::5::l}-->\r\nWe weren\'t due to start until the following day, but since I was staying there (it was a residential studio, essential for the kind of hell for leather approach we had decided to take) and there was nobody in the big room that night I took the rest of the day setting up and tuning my drums. Then to sleep before the big first day.\r\n\r\nTo be honest my memories of the following week are disjointed and fractured. It was working at a fairly insane pace. I did 16 hour days almost every day, except for in the last couple of mixing days where they were closer to 18 hours as we tried to get everything finished. I was bouncing back and forth between drumming, listening, playing bass, producing, getting good takes out of Jonathan on guitar and vocals (thankfully that was falling-off-a-log easy, as he was fully prepared and totally professional) and making sure that everything was proceeding fast enough to complete the album before the deadline. <!--{b::6::r}-->There were also mini deadlines to fit to as well - we had a string quartet coming in one afternoon, so everything with strings on had to be complete by then; we had a group of Jonthan\'s friends coming in to do some group claps and vibe, so that song had to be far enough along by that point; there was one day where we couldn\'t use the main studio, so all the drums had to be complete by then, since it would have been inefficient to tear down the whole thing and try and recreate it the day after. <!--{b::7::l}-->My job was made slightly more fraught by the fact that the engineer assigned to us was somewhat junior, meaning I was also taking on a lot of the engineering role (microphones, placement, wiring stuff up) as well.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of it me and Jonathan only had one argument (I don\'t even remember what it was about), which, given the time pressure and how tired we were getting, was impressive. But mostly my memories are all positive and happy. I had put together string arrangements for quite a number of the songs, and recording them with the amazing string quartet that Jonathan had found was incredibly satisfying.<!--{b::8::r}-->\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning I had suggested that we record on analogue tape, not for any luddite reasons of â€˜warmth\' or â€˜organic feel\', but simply because in my experience it forces you to make decisions faster. For instance, when recording a vocal on digital nowadays you will tend to record 4, 5 or 6 runs through the entire track and then compile bits of those into a final master take. Comping (as it is called) is incredibly tedious, and massively time consuming. When recording Jonathan we had one track of analogue tape. If a line was wrong we\'d just do it again until it was right and then move on. This approach doesn\'t work unless you have a really skilful singer to work with, but thankfully he was exactly that. Some songs <!--{b::9::l}-->(like The Bigger Picture) he nailed in one take of guitar and vocal together. Breathtaking.\r\n\r\nThe biggest disappointment for me was not really being able to get a handle on You Don\'t Know. I had warned when I was hired that I\'m not the kind of producer who can make hits. I don\'t even know what hits are. I know how to be sensitive and get to the crux of a song and make it beautiful, but as for making something that will fit a radio formatâ€¦ well, I\'ve got no fucking clue. And it turns out - so easy in retrospect! - that You Don\'t Know was just a simple and brilliant pop song, while I was turning over every stone in the garden trying to find its uniqueness and difference. Wrong wrong wrong - should have kept it simple and direct.\r\n\r\nI mixed all the songs in one big batch. Just to prove that I was no luddite, as soon as we were mixing I transferred over to ProTools and did it mostly in the box. For mixing fast it\'s the perfect tool - repeatability, tweakability, fast and precise adjustments. I can\'t remember how long I had to mix the nine songs, but I have a feeling it was two and a half days. I had a hell of a headache by the end of it, but Milow had an album, and that was the idea.\r\n\r\nThe following month Jonathan went back into the studio without me to have another crack at You Don\'t Know, this time in a folk arrangement. It was wise of him, because we\'d really missed the mark, but there was an air of miffedness, even though I knew it was pointless for him to try it with me again. The version of the album with this second attempt at YDK was the one released ten years and a couple of days ago. It didn\'t immediately explode, but it did move his career forwards. Not until he teamed up with Belgian superproducer Jo Francken in 2007 did he properly nail You Don\'t Know, finally making it into the hit that it was supposed to be, taking The Bigger Picture to gold status with it. When I was on the road backing Andy Yorke in late 2007 we supported Milow at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels where he presented me with my gold record.\r\n<!--{b::10::r}-->\r\nAnd that was it. In the UK our music scene is pretty sealed off from the continent so I didn\'t fully appreciate how ginormous he had become commercially. When we were playing the AB Club in Brussels with Frank in 2009 the radio was on in catering while we were eating, and I thought I recognised the voice singing. I checked with a local who gave me a funny look, the undercurrent of which I now understand to be \"you haven\'t heard Ayo Technology by Milow? When it\'s on every radio station every hour? What rock have you been hiding under?\"\r\n\r\nI\'m proud - really proud of helping Milow achieve what he wanted with The Bigger Picture with my playing and advice and listening, proud of the string parts (particularly) and the arrangements I devised for the tracks, and happy to have been a small early part of his huge and ongoing DIY success. ',26),(27,'<!--{i::1::c}-->\r\nTo get the obvious out of the way, it\'s been a <i>HUGE</i> amount of time since my last blog. I guess I haven\'t really had anything to say that I thought was worth sharing? I mean, there\'s a host of splendid things to consume out on the internet, and I didn\'t feel the need to add any more to it.\r\n\r\nBut I\'ve redesigned the website, and I have a new record I\'m spankingly proud of coming out soon, and I guess perhaps I will throw some thoughts of things and stuff out there. For those of you who are wondering, currently with the website revamp I haven\'t re-added the ability to comment (although you can see old comments on previous blogs), but I\'ll get to it.\r\n\r\nRecently I released a new version of my 2003 debut album <b><i>miseryguts</i></b>. Some of it is almost indistinguishable from the original, some sounds like it\'s had a polish, and some are more obviously changed. It\'s like the Star Wars special editions, and if you listen to it, it will be up to you to decide which bits are \'Millennium Falcon flying out of Mos Eisley\' awesome, and which are \'Greedo shoots first\' laaaaame (I am deeply hoping there\'s nothing as bad as \'Playstation 1 cutscene Jabba talks to Han\'...) <!--{q::1::l}-->\r\n\r\nIt was something I\'d considered as long ago as 2015, when <b><i>in amber</i></b> was coming out (do I have a problem with capitalisation? It\'s possible!). When I was making miseryguts home recording music technology was not quite the miracle that it is nowadays. You could make records in a computer (indeed both Unbelievable Truth albums started out with home recordings that were then taken into proper studios), but everything sounded much worse - reverbs, eq, compression were still all in their relative infancy as computer programs, certainly ones that my humble Apple was capable of running.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, my mind wasn\'t very clear in terms of how I wanted it to sound. You can get a more general history of the record over on the <a href = \"?page=music\">music</a> page (the notes section underneath miseryguts has plenty of detail), but in terms of my state of mind I was still struggling with the ending of Unbelievable Truth and how I should proceed with things. For instance I seemed hell-bent on a minimal number of instruments - as an example, I restricted <i>Beginning To Wonder</i> to just one electric guitar, which to my future ears made it sound somewhat thinner.\r\n\r\nSo when in amber was in the process of being released I came back to the original recordings of miseryguts and started thinking about sprucing them up a bit so I could feel prouder and more confident about the album. At that time though I only got as far as tackling BTW. As far as possible I tried not to change, or remove, anything that was there, but felt ok about adding things. Extra processing and layering in some <a href = \"https://www.stevenslatedrums.com/\" target=\"_blank\">samples</a> on the drums helped bring it to life a bit, and to fill it out I added 3 or 4 extra guitars. Compare here:\r\n\r\nOld version: <!--{a::1::n}-->, new version: <!--{S::1::n}-->\r\n\r\nI was happy with it, but touring got too busy to finish it all off, and the whole idea got shoved very much to the back-burner. I got another nudge on it in 2016, when I was asked to be the \'artist\' for a <a href = \"https://www.recordproduction.com/record-producer-features/production-masterclass-1.html\" target = \"_blank\">recordproduction.com production masterclass</a> at the excellent <a href = \"https://www.woodwormstudios.co.uk/\" target = \"_blank\">Woodworm Studios</a>. In order to have something to record I had another shot at <i>The Everlasting Mile</i>, which ended up sounding really great under the auspices of producers Mike Exeter, Clint Murphy and my old pal George Shilling - it\'s not the final mixed version but you can get an idea from the video on the page linked above. It still didn\'t inspire me to finish the rest of the record though...\r\n\r\n<!--{q::2::r}-->The final catalyst was a two-pronged thing. First, after finishing my new album in lockdown I was bereft of much to do. To play Saudade around to people I had uploaded it to my Soundcloud, but because of the restrictions of the free version I had had to delete something else on there, and miseryguts got the chop. A few days later I got a text from my daughter complaining that <i>You Get My Best</i> had disappeared from Soundcloud. I was a bit surprised that she was a regular listener of it (although I know she did have an affinity with it, since it was written about her and her brother), but this finally gave me the nudge to get on a do a new version of that song, and from there complete the rest of the record over a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nHere\'s another comparison, of The Everlasting Mile, the song that probably changed most significantly (inspired by the Record Production session):\r\n\r\nOld version: <!--{a::2::n}-->, new version: <!--{S::2::n}-->\r\n\r\nOne thing that I found heartening working on the 2020 version was being much more comfortable with my voice. Back in 2002 when I was making it I was very self-conscious of my singing, which I think was the result of having worked with two singers of celestial talent (Andy Yorke and Mark Mulcahy) in the recent years. Coming back to it with the benefit of a bit of distance I didn\'t find it uncomfortable like I thought I would, and in the case of something like <i>Pleasure Babies</i> actually found myself removing some of the processing I\'d done on the original mix to try and hide it.\r\n\r\nAnyhoo. That\'s enough blabber. Congratulations if you\'ve got this far. If you haven\'t heard the new mixes yet, feel free to go to <a href = \"https://open.spotify.com/album/2kdm6WCTO6l0XDndIcwaMb?si=j-g10cEgTLuxOMrKv7KOrg\" target = \"_blank\">Spotify</a> or wherever you consume your music to check it out. And once I mend the comments section you can come and let me know what you think!',27),(28,'Lots of people I know consider me a prog fan. While it\'s undoubtedly true that I appreciate more prog rock than any other acquaintances I have, I still don\'t consider myself a \'progger\'. I guess by that I mean it I don\'t consume it unquestioningly, and in fact vast tracts of the oevre annoy me. Whether it\'s one woman with an acoustic guitar singing simple songs about her life, or a band of Bill Bailey-alikes getting some serious noodle on, all I really want is for it to touch me, and communicate something to me.\r\n\r\nTo that end I have created a playlist on Spotify of the prog that actually really does something for me. I thought I\'d take the opportunity to do an accompanying blog, for those who wondered why this and not that. It\'s a little bit like my old Bloggin\' The Shuffle (which I\'m intending to get back to sometime)  entries, but I chose the songs. So put on the playlist, listen along, and hear me tell of why these songs don\'t make my butthole pucker like so much widdly widdly progressive arse!\r\n\r\n<!--{S::1::n}-->\r\n\r\n<h3>Trains - Porcupine Tree</h3>\r\n\r\nI came to Porcupine Tree relatively late. Although I guess it can\'t have been that late since I remember first hearing this on MySpace. It immediately appealed as an actual positive idea of progression, in that it took some of the elements of what prog rock had been, but was quite happy to incorporate feels and markers from more recent times. It was also just a gorgeously written song. A lot of prog rock suffers, to my ears, from being determined to be prog first, and listen to the song second, where as this is clearly led by the song and the emotions it wants to communicate, and is happy to serve the song with some progressive idioms. It also helps my appreciation of this band that their drummer Gavin Harrison is a true phenomenon, a brilliant creative thinker. Check out my cover of The Sound Of Muzak on my YouTube channel for my hopefully not too risible attempt to recreate his classic drum part.\r\n\r\n<h3>Warm Wet Circles - Marillion</h3>\r\n\r\nOne of only two bands who get more than one entry, and both bands get multiple songs for essentially the same reason - that they were two very distinct outfits in their career. This is from the Fish-led years in the 80s. I grew up with this band, so of course they are going to have a very special place in my heart, as everyone\'s childhood discoveries always do. While their BIG album was Misplaced Childhood (which included the big hit Kayleigh, and the almost as big hit Lavender), this is from what is I think their finest early achievement, its follow-up Clutching At Straws. They grabbed me early on by their combining of an obvious prog sensibility (although definitely informed by parts of the concurrent New Romanticism) with Fish\'s poetry. Their forebears were often quite \'sword and sorcery\' in their choice of lyrical content, but Derek William Dick (yes, that\'s his real name) was much more at home dealing, albeit beautifully poetically, with the more standard lyrical concerns of heartbreak and trauma. The whole album deals with his descending into what is reputed to be a self-destructive alcoholism, and combining that with the grandiosity of the music is a heady mixture.\r\n\r\n<h3>Mama - Genesis</h3>\r\n\r\nAnd the other band with the double entries on this particular chart. One of my earliest musical passions, and they gave me two of my favourite albums ever - 1973\'s Selling England By The Pound and the self-titled 1983 record that this opens. While many of their 70s contemporaries made their way in the 80s sounding like the same band but with better recording technology, Genesis actually did progress and reinvent and become something different. I love this track. The whole sound of it, the arrangement, the slow build, the frankly absurdly huge drums that enter very late (no guv, never heard In The Air Tonight, nope), and a truly incredible vocal take. Phil Collins will always be one of my favourite drummers, but he was coming into his Lennon-esque own at this point of his career, and this is one of the high spots of his throat shredding passionate performances.\r\n\r\n<h3>Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd</h3>\r\n\r\nIt\'s just a great great song, by any metric. And the incredible heart-breaking subtlety of Dave Gilmour\'s opening acoustic guitar solo is sublime. What makes it prog I wonder? It\'s short and doesn\'t contain any instrumental pyrotechnics, no weird time signatures, no ghosts or goblins. Doesn\'t matter. Unbelievable Truth used to cover this when we were playing acoustically in the very early days. So I got to hear Andy Yorke to sing this a bunch of times, and yes, it was amazing.\r\n\r\n<h3>15 Step - Radiohead</h3>\r\n\r\nSomething from the \'we\'re not a prog band, honest\' old school mates and friends. Their trick was to smuggle in the prog by making it danceable - no one will notice it\'s in 5/4 if they\'re jiggling about to the twitchy magnificence of it. I don\'t like everything they\'ve done (hi there, King Of Limbs), but man when\r\nthey\'re good, they\'re the best. And Colin Greenwood, always underrated. That bass run at 2.07 and then the whole outro... he was always the funky soul of the band. Awesome.\r\n\r\n<h3>Awake And Nervous - IQ</h3>\r\n\r\nThe first song played at the first proper gig I chose to go to. I\'ve always appreciated what this band brought into my life. While the other prog influences\r\nat that time were quite \'big time\' - big gigs, top production, big record companies - IQ were do it yourself, touring in a tiny van in tiny places. The album this is taken from was entirely recorded and mixed in 4 days, which for such an insanely musical ambitious piece of work is mental. To some extent it sounds it, in that it is deeply technically imperfect, and all the better for it. For me it is the proper connection between prog rock and punk - it\'s all just music, people doing what they\'re passionate about whatever it takes, and the scratchy lo-fi sound of it still turns me on all this time later. Their albums got more technically proficient as they went on, and while they were never bad, they never recaptured the spirit of their debut.\r\n\r\n<h3>Cinema Show - Genesis</h3>\r\n\r\nHad to include a live Genesis song. They were always much better then than on record. I would have chosen the live version of Supper\'s Ready from 1973 on the archive box set, but it isn\'t on Spotify, so you\'ll have to have this instead. Phil Collins\' drumming in the keyboard solo at the end is forever inspirational, and the moment the mellotron choir enters at 7.43 is a transcendent musical feeling I\'ve tried to recapture my whole life. Link to an above band - I used to play this endlessly to Jonny at school, and I will claim that the mellotron choir in Lucky and The Tourist are a direct result of me torturing him.\r\n \r\n<h3>Neverland - Marillion</h3>\r\n \r\nAnd a song from the second incarnation of Marillion. This is the quintessence of what prog rock can do. So incredibly emotional, unconcerned with fitting into a 3 or 4 minute time frame or a prescribed verse / chorus structure, just following the feeling and what it means. I was fortunate enough to perform this with the band in a rehearsal room once. I managed not to cry, which is probably the only time I\'ve heard this song and not.\r\n\r\n<h3>Supper\'s Ready - Genesis</h3>\r\n\r\nBecause I couldn\'t get the live version earlier. Like a mini movie, essentially a whole side of a record linked together, becoming more than the sum of its parts in a way that it couldn\'t as separate songs. And I always cry when it finally returns to \"and it\'s Hey Babe! with your guardian eyes so blue\". \r\n\r\nThat\'s a lot of blabber. But what can I say, I\'m passionate about it all. Thanks for listening and reading if you got this far! Let me know your prog thoughts in the comments below',28),(44,'Done the first gig then. Sunday on this site someone pointed out that Mark Mulcahy had cancelled his UK tour. Knowing that his scheduled gig at the point was the second to last night there ever, I offered to fill the gap for Mac, the promoter there. He said let\'s go for it. Oh shit. Five days to get a set together from scratch. Called in Jim and Jase, naturally (especially since Jase was fairly familiar with many of the songs, having played a fair few of them for the recording), and Dominic Lash who played upright bass on a few other songs. Three rehearsals, only two where everybody could turn up. The first one sounded arse. The second sounded OK. The last one on Friday afternoon sounded good. I\'ll let people on the message board tell you how the gig was (I didn\'t have the best view), but I certainly enjoyed it, and want to do more. Looking forward to the Living Room shows, I should be finalising everything in the next couple of weeks.',29),(45,'As promised, now that it\'s all over, here\'s how the living room shows and the band shows looked from where I was standing...\n<strong>Ulen\'s LRC, March 20th:</strong> Just up the road for me, this one. Probably the most terrifying, it being first, and also the smallest living room, meaning I felt like I was practically on top of the people watching. Nerves got the better of me at the start, making abortive first attempts at Beginning to Wonder and the keyboard solo in Gulag Parenting. But it got better as it went on...\n<strong>Deb\'s LRC, March 22nd:</strong> A combination of domestic chores and horrendous traffic \'round the M25 (plus slightly underestimating the mammoth trek out to the east coast from my manor) meant I turned up when I said I\'d be starting. Hurled the equipment into the tastefully decorated room (the fairy lights were a great pleasure after the bare interrogation-style bulb at Ulen\'s house) and started straight in, this time with the less challenging Pleasure Babies, having learned the lesson of the previous night. Special addition was Everyone Has To Eat, which Deb was desperate to hear but UT never got it together to play, so that hopefully made up for that. Apart from that, my memories are relatively sparse, due to the ARRIVE! SET UP! PLAY! GO HOME! urgency of the whole thing. It was OK, though. Apparently.\n<strong>Ian\'s LRC, March 23rd:</strong> Once again arriving a bit behind schedule, althought this was due to an error in navigation. It turned out that I wasn\'t the only one, since there was quite a long wait while others lost in the long shadow cast by Canary Wharf sought out the right street. A few more additions to the set at this one - Chasing The High, which I\'d finally got around to finishing the recording of that week, and had suddenly leapt up in my estimation as a song, a cover of From Out Of Nowhere by Faith No More, that I had attempted the previous night, but singularly failed to recall the first line of, and, on a whim, an old old old song called Hopeless, which kind of came out OK, I think. With a touch more confidence, I think I played and sang better at this show than any of the others, and, even better, I found my way out of the labyrinth of roads and back home in only a few days.\n<strong>Rehearsals for shows, 8 / 9 / 10 April:</strong> In keeping with my first show, a minimal amount of rehearsal for a completely new band again. Loz the drummer couldn\'t manage anything earlier, so that was that. Didn\'t really seem to matter though, since it fell together pretty fast. Jamie Dustball seemed a little out of sorts, until he realised that I was very happy for him to make crunchy squealing noises on his guitar at every opportunity (I wanted a guitarist with a bit more edge, Jim\'s country rock dam having recently burst spectacularly). It wasn\'t all smooth sailing - on the second day attempts at Chasing The High and Nightlight were rapidly aborted when they couldn\'t quite capture the necessary moods, resulting in the emergency additions of Blind Man and Into The Hills (Loz and Jamie having not heard ITH, it came out quite magnificently different from the demo). By the third day, we had a set, ran through it three times, and went home with crossed fingers...\n<strong>The Point, Oxford, April 11th:</strong> It doesn\'t matter where he goes, it\'s always a pleasure to play the gig that Mac is running.  Started a little shaky, but got the bull by the horns as it went on (these are just my opinions, naturally - hopefully some of the people who were spectating will avail themselves of the message board and tell you what it was like from the other side). Made a bit of a toss of the Gulag Parenting keyboard solo when it occured to me after a bar or so that it was total prog rock, and that Mark Kelly from Marillion was watching, and that I saw Marillion a whole bunch of times from \'82 - \'86, and he was a great keyboard player, in fact I learned to play mostly from working out Marillion albums, and what the hell must he be thinking, oh shit, my fingers appear to have stopped working. Apart from that, I think we got through it well.\n<strong>The Dublin Castle, London, April 12th:</strong> The Manics claimed (and failed to fulfill) that they were going to break up after one album. Well, I think we got them beat there, band formed on Monday, last gig on Friday (maybe - if I can afford to I\'d really like to use the same band again. In fact the biggest downer about the whole thing was that I was beginning to get to the point of trying to get distribution for what I\'d already recorded and get it out as a record, but now I\'d rather re-record everything with this band, which is sadly prohibitively expensive at the moment). A fairly nicely busy night, took me right back it did, having to compete with the blah blah blah from the bar. Because of the chatting, Directions, which had really captured the mood the previous night, seemed to get a little bit lost. It was all pretty rocking, to be honest. My voice seemed a good deal less condident than the previous night, and Jamie seemed to be involved in his own personal NIGHT OF A THOUSAND SCREW UPS!, but it was very enjoyable, particularly Gulag Parenting, which floated my boat a lot - I managed to feel a little bit more like an observer to that song, and thought it was good. Which isn\'t like me. Unfortunately, I should have left it at that, but not knowing whether or not I\'d be playing again, I came back for an encore, a truly awful version of Nightlight (I don\'t think I\'ve ever tried to play it standing up, and man that song is a fiend to play). But hey, human frailty and all, it could have been worse.',30),(46,'So, it\'s been over a year since the last tour diary, a year in which much recording has been done, and much lack of self esteem has been wrestled. Now I\'m in a kind of \"f**k it\" mood, I\'ve ladled loads of pressure on myself because a) I\'ve been trying to make my way as a musician for so arse-numbingly long now, I have to try and make it as good as I can, and b) because \'the band I was in before\' were so good, and acheived a fair amount, I was making it so whatever I was doing had to live up to that. But now, the album is done (or next to, there\'s about 3 hours work left to do on it that I just have to find the properly inspired moment for), and I will press up 1000 copies, and make it available on the site (mail order or by credit card through oxfordmusic.net), and maybe I\'ll sell all / some / none of them and it doesn\'t really matter, since I\'m basically happy with it, and it might not be as good as some things that I\'ve been involved with before, but hey. who cares?\nSo in that spirit I\'m getting out there to start doing some gigs. It\'s been over a year since there was a tour diary because, of course, it\'s been over a year since I did a gig of my own, so I wanted to ease myself back into it. And how better than a gig with a profile so low it\'s own mother was probably unaware of it\'s existence. The Headington Community Development Association (Headington is a part of Oxford) were putting on a day of events, street dancing, various acts on various stages, and I got on board. So I turned up at the modest Royal Standard pub at about 12.45 pm, watched the act before me play a few covers of irish folk songs, negro spirituals and the like (and it was nice not to be the oldest performer of the day, by quite some margin) to some people who were clearly just after a calming lunchtime pint, but were quite happy to have some musical accompaniament (spell check on that word please, message board team).\nI set up the piano and guitar (the guitar misbehaved a little but I cracked the whip, ho yus), there was a two or three people I new scattered around, and I played some songs. That\'s it really. Since it was my first time out, I just did whatever took my fancy, I didn\'t have anybody expecting to hear anything, and my main task was to be relaxed and enjoy it. So the set was:\n<strong>Pleasure Babies</strong>, played as fast as I could manage.\n<strong>The Everlasting Mile</strong>, I\'ve never been sure about the recording of this, but whenever I play it live it seems to come across as a really good song.\n<strong>Zack and Sarah</strong>, by Ben Folds, of course. I worked it out the day before, and I felt like playing something fast and jolly.\nthen a little struggle across to the guitar for...\n<strong>Into The Hills</strong>, this one\'s doubtlessly improved by the prescence of the boy Moulster, but I think I did OK without him.\n<strong>Lifestyles</strong>, I kind of thought the subtelty of this one would die without some kind of attentive audience, but either I really didn\'t care, or it was actually OK.\nBeginning To Wonder was supposed to come between those two guitar songs, but since I fuck up the riff four times out of five, and again it rests on the work of the boy Moulster more than just a bit, I decided to shorten the set by one. It was a unilateral decision. So, back to the piano...\n<strong>The Last Human Gateway (middle section)</strong>, ah prog rock, where would we be without you? A little bit of an old old IQ track, I love this bit of music and probably enjoyed this the most in the set. My brother was there, and he recognised it.\n<strong>Fred Jones part 2</strong>, the set I had planned finished with Gulag Parenting, but again, I just suddenly fancied another Ben Folds number, this song is just so perfectly good.\nAnd that was that. The people who didn\'t know why on earth there was a racket going on in the corner of their pub were somewhere between bemused and polite, I got paid (unbelievably), and left. There are now more gigs coming up, more serious ones, and I\'m looking forward to them most excellently. Hope to see you there.',31),(47,'SO.... MUCH..... CODE.....!\r\n\r\nSorry, having a moment there. Someone asked on the message board where I find time to play with Dive Dive, do this, bring up kids and plan and execute the elaborate jewel heists that pay the rent (only kidding, inspector). I don\'t. But just in case that wasn\'t enough, I\'ve also taken on the somewhat ridiculous task of trying to code the online shop for the release of miserguts. What a headache! Still, better than having to pay 25% in comission to another online shop.\r\n\r\nAmidst all of this, me and Jason actually found time to rehearse properly for the show last night. Of course, being something vaguely related to UT, all of the hard work nearly came to nothing when Jase came down with one of his legendary (around these parts) migraines during the afternoon, the gig only ultimately being saved by a quick burst of shiatsu (is that how it\'s spelt? or is that a dog?) on his forehead by the venue sound man minutes before we went on. Maybe these hippies have got something...\r\n\r\nIt was the Give it some \'Stic acoustic night at the Bullingdon Arms, run by super-truperdour Ady Davey (jason reminded me on the way home that Ady\'s band from a little while a go, Pod, had one absolute killer song). On before me was an old friend Rob Jolliffe, we were at school together, I recorded his band and filled in for their drummer once on a couple of hours notice. Good old Rob, never one to do the obvious, no hacking away on an acoustic prentending to be Jeff Buckley for him, no sirree. Voice and Bodhran (ask an Irish friend) over a CD backing, with the song titles printed clearly on A4 displayed on the front of the stage (he would flip the page over before each song). Hoorah!\r\n\r\nMe and Jase played, and I liked it. Hark at me and my Liam Gallagher-esque bigging up of myself. Adding some things to the learning experience - because of the way I set up, it was kind of like playing a gig to the wall, so I won\'t do that again, and try and look the audience in the eye a little more, even when there\'s a blinding spot pointed straight at you from their direction, making it painful to even squint towards them. Had to make a quick getaway afterwards to deliver hurting Jase back home. And that was it.\r\n\r\nHopefully something exciting and rock and roll will happen at the next show to make the diary more exciting. Something involving lions and tigers / copious drug and alcohol intake / super models / and other airfix brands / nuclear explosions in the desert and the deposing of the US president by a dastardly vice president (delete as you wish)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToodle pip.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. if you want to know about what I do with Dive Dive, head to <a href = \"http://www.divedive.co.uk/\" target = \"_blank\">their site</a> where I do a tour diary relevant to that band. Or not.',32),(48,'I feel like an addict. After getting the shop working and setting it live, I\'d intended today to be a no-code day... but 20 minutes after getting up I was doing, just a little, to get me going, iron out a few kinks. Worse than heroin.\r\nBut thankfully the last couple of nights have been what it\'s all <em>supposed</em> to be about. I remember, doing music.\r\nNot that Thursday at The Railway in Winchester (that\'s a pub, not actually on the tracks) was a buoying up kind of experience. Apparently GCSE and A level results were out, and one of the support bands brought a load of mates from school to get pissed up and celebrate... but more of that later. I only saw the last three songs of the first fella, sorry, didn\'t catch the name, but I liked it in that shy, tremulous, one-too-many Jeff Buckley albums kind of way. The aformentioned School Band were next (Geko? Was that their name? Do I give a fuck?), and were bad. Anyone who reads my diaries on the <a href = \"http://www.divedive.co.ukl\" target = \"_blank\">Dive Dive</a> site knows I\'m not ageist, there\'s young bands out there who blow me away, and make me feel like an embarrassed old irrelevance. Not this band though. The drummer (of course I\'d focus on that first) appeared to have started playing that afternoon, but hadn\'t practiced all that much since then, the two guitarists were reasonable I suppose, and they had one of those girl singers who could sound reasonable doing some drunken karaoke, but sadly has deluded herself into thinking she could front a band. But hey, they have youth on their side.\r\nI regret I can\'t remember the name of the third band, something like Kung Phu Phinga Picka and the yadda yadda yadda. They were at times awesomely good though, my favourite bits when they were being acoustic drum and bass. Hope I get to see them again. Two complaints - 1) they overran, not because their set was long but because they faffed about terribly between songs (buy a tuner, don\'t lose the audience), and 2) (and here\'s probably somewhat more of an explanation as to why I\'ve been a little harsh towards Geko) the second band had decamped to a table in the venue and proceeded to have shouted conversations with their stupid fat bitch friends (sorry for the bad words, but I can\'t stand that kind of selfish rudeness). I mean shit, there was a really good band playing, who had had the decency to keep quiet through their set, and I (and many others) could barely hear some of what they were doing over the high decibel Fat Slags schtick going on behind me.\r\nAnd do you know what? They just got louder and louder, so by the time me and Jase played, there were moments when I couldn\'t hear myself onstage over the dreadful cackling warble of pissed up slappers. I\'m getting very excitingly worked up and punk angry here, aren\'t I. So, we played some songs, I forgot some words because of the noise, and we pushed off miserably home. Not much more to report about it - maybe Ulen can add his ha\'penny worth, but I doubt he could hear much out front either.\r\n\r\nThank god then for last night at The Port Mahon in Oxford. Great room, first time I\'d been there, it was just like the Briton\'s Protection in Manchester where I played with Mark Mulcahy once. Whoever was supposed to be supporting had decided to go to a wedding instead, but only told the promoter the previous day, so he asked if I\'d like to support as well (actually he first asked Jase to do a support set, but our man Moulster demurred...). Sure, why not? So come 9.30 pm we started off, not many people had turned up by then because they were expecting me to headling, and therefore be on 10 / 10.15, but what the hey, I enjoy just playing, so we got on with it. It was all quite random, so I\'m not sure I can remember the first set (indeed I couldn\'t remember some of the songs while I was playing them)... hang on, I remember we started with Hurry Please Hurry by the unmitigated genius that is <a href = \"http://www.markmulcahy.com\" target = \"_blank\">Mark Mulcay</a>, there was a couple of Ben Folds songs in there, Cap\'n Tom Sharpe had come along so he got up to do three songs (and man is he \'kin great), and me and Jase did Same Mistakes without Andy for the first time (we strummed through it when we were setting up, which is the only reason it came to mind). Then a quick Vegas-style break at ten past ten for people to hit the bar, before we started our \'proper\' set at 10.20.\r\n<strong>The Everlasting Mile</strong> First, as per usual.\r\n<strong>Into The Hills</strong> I started with a mental block, but managed to shake it off. M\'colleagues Jamie and Ben from Dive Dive arrived halfway through this one...\r\n<strong>Beginning To Wonder</strong> ...and Jim went to the bar at the start of this one. Buggering song, probably the oldest thing in the set and I still can\'t bloody well manage the guitar part.\r\n<strong>Lifestyles</strong> Love doing this one, can\'t wait to record it for album no. 2. There\'s already 12 songs finished or near as dammit, if I can keep up my energy and esteem levels, I\'m hoping to have it out in six months or so.\r\n<strong>Pleasure Babies</strong> Jase had been working really hard on the backing vocals, but Jim ruined it by heckling just before we played. Bah.\r\n<strong>Ghosts</strong> Poofed out of playing this the night before, I just can\'t really get comfortable with it acoustically, not least because I always make a tit of the instrumental verse, but Jase like it, so just because I love him so.\r\n<strong>The Last Human Gateway</strong> I\'m enjoying this song (or rather this bit of song) more and more every time we play.\r\n<strong>This Isn\'t What I expected</strong> Slight mistake here, in that this song is hard to sing at the best of times, but damn near impossible after already having been stretching the vocal cords for an hour. So the very bottom notes wobbled like a dingy full of clog dancers, and the very top notes disappeared into a strained whisper.\r\n<strong>Gulag Parenting</strong> The P.A. decided to join in right at the end with a very unusual high pitched whine which brought the set to a fine climax. (Jamie claimed it was him texting the bar downstairs for a final round)\r\n\r\nAnd then, after not very much encouragement, an encore of \"Everyone Says That You\'re So Fragile\" by iDLEWILD. I was jsut about to have another go at Nightlight, but bottled it...\r\n\r\nNow the shop\'s working I can try and work on getting more shows, so see you out there!',33),(49,'A quick report on the last gig. The best I\'ve done so far I think (not that there\'s many to choose from), it\'s beginning to feel a bit less \"oh crap, what note comes next?\" and a bit more \"y\'know, I think I\'m enjoyting this\". Nice venue as well, and good to see some familiar faces from faraway places. And yes, in answer to the message board comments, I also think the 12 Bar would be a good gig to try and get, I\'m looking into it.',34),(50,'Some gigs are just ace, and really to be enjoyed, and thankfully both yesterday in London and the day before in Oxford were in that file. Different kettles of fish in many ways though...\r\nThe Port Mahon was much more of a DIY gig. I arrived at six o\'clock with much more stuff than anyone should need for a simple acoustic show, and carried most of it in myself (thanks to Jamie Dive Dive for coming along to help me with the back-breakingly heavy items), and then proceeded to put the P.A. together in the best way I could from the speakers and boxes of (tangled) cables and stuff that I\'d brought to augment it, knowing from the first time around what I needed to bring. Emm arrived at about 6.30, followed not too much later by Lord Francis, aka Sean, who had already begun his days adventures (car broken down on way, had to get it towed back to Milton Keynes. where he\'d started from, and then get a bus to Oxford). A very relaxed soundcheck followed, and then we tried to beautify the room for the evening.\r\nMe and Emm had left it up in the air as to who was going to headline, but the makeup of the audience seemed to be more in her favour (as you would think it would be, her being on her 6th album and me on my 1st), and after hearing her soundcheck, frankly her voice is so good that I really didn\'t have any desire to follow her on. Sean played first, with an early Bowie vibe and some rocking tunes done acoustically. I enjoyed my gig. A lot in fact. The audience was really good to everybody, real pin drop silence when anyone was playing (apart from the occasional loud interjection from the somewhat pissed and undoubtedly over-horny doorman during Emm\'s set), and my voice felt really good that night. It\'s something you can\'t begin to appreciate when you just play an instrument and co the occasional backing vocal until you start doing it for yourself, but being a singer can be a very wierd thing, when sometimes, for no apparent reason, your instrument just doesn\'t want to work properly. Due to my lack of Jason I couldn\'t do This Isn\'t What I Expected (sorry Ulen), substituting it for my favourite Ben Folds cover, Fred Jones Part Two. Then I turned soundman again for Emm\'s show, and everything all around was good, only marred by finding out on the message board the following morning that Robin had trained all the way to Oxford and then failed to locate the venue. Sorry fella, I put the address and phone number of the place on the site, it\'s the best I could do...\r\nThe Betsey Trotwood was much different, full-on professional stuff, no need for me to bring any P.A. bits, no siree. But what fun I had sitting motionless on the A40 coming into London for a couple of hours, making me very late. I\'m only glad that I had opted to pay the congestion charge after getting to London, since when I finally got into the ZONE it was well past 7 o\'clock. £5 saved! Woo hoo! The gig itself is a very lovely and very tiny venue, it toto probably about the same size as the Port, but with much of it partitioned off into little alcoves (into which the management had thoughtfully installed litte T.V.s with a video camera trained on the stage feeding them, so you can comfortably sit down, still hear the gig but not have to be in the main stink of people). For some reason I couldn\'t rev my voice up properly for my set, it wasn\'t under control, the only thing I can think of is that I shouldn\'t have sung my way through Clutching at Straws by Marillion at full volume in the car on  the way down, Fish\'s range is a little higher than mine... It was a good gig all the same though, I think (Ian, Emily, et al please feel free to correct me...) (isn\'t there a lot of ellipses in this tour diary...?) (...yes...). Emm was once again impressive being joined by God-like guitarist Bernard Butler for a song (he used my guitar! I\'ll never wash it again!). A fun couple of gigs. A shame it wasn\'t a whole tour.',35),(51,'Only time for a very quick report on last night\'s show, got to rush off to Ipswich for a Dive Dive gig. Most people made it through the travel madness caused by the anti-Bush demoing, which was heartening. Me and Jase only made it there about half and hour before we were due on, so a quick line-check and that was it. We whiled away our last few minutes before going onstage watching Sky News with the sound down, which appeared to be showing footage of a very very slow car chase involving Michael Jackson.\r\nAnd then, y\'know, another gig. Different setlist to last time at the Betsey because of the prescence of the boy Moulster, so This Isn\'t What I Expected got back into the set, and I think it was the best we\'ve ever done it in front of people. On a whim half way through I replaced Lifestyles with a cover of The Way She Really Is by the genius Mark Mulcahy (add that to the long list of UT and UT-related covers of MM songs), and I\'m glad I did. Jase had a bit of an incident in Pleasure Babies, but we kept grinning and soldiered on. Enjoyed the gig again. Must do more...',36),(52,'If you only do one gig every few months, at least make sure it\'s bloody miles away. Due to some unavoidable circumstance, me and Jase left very late, and the drive was enormous, meaning the doors had been open for some time when we finally arrived there.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I had my doubts about the gig. The photos on the website showed a working men\'s club stage with a gold curtain around the back which looked like it was more used to playing host to Elvis impersonators and ventriloquists. And possibly Bernard Manning. This was compounded a little when we pulled up at the outside of the place, a (lets face it) ugly brick box reminiscent of Phoenix Nights. But an entirely different fear came over us when we finally got into the place, to be faced with a large room packed to the gills with kids (mostly 16 - 19 year olds so it looked, although everyone under 25 is young looking to me nowadays) who were clearly primed to rock. We dumped the gear at the side of the stage, watched the first song of the first act (a young fella who everybody seemed to know personally doing a Leonard Cohen song) and then retired somewhere quiet for a stiff nerve-steadying drink.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally went on, it was a good deal less bad than I\'d feared, certainly nowhere near the league of the Winchester debacle. It took me back somewhat to early UT gigs, where there were a certain amount of rapt people obviously taking in what was being played, and a larger opposing contingent who failed to notice our presence and chatted constantly. For our part, I think we played a good gig, the odd muff notwithstanding, and I felt more confident about my voice than ever before (it\'s deeply sad how a few positive words about the voice in reviews can make me feel better about myself). Like an idiot I left the box of albums at home, so I couldn\'t sell any to the people who asked afterwards, but it was a really good experience overall, not a little bit down to the very cool people of Panic Promotions (there appeared to be about thirty of them) who put the gig on. It\'s such a great pleasure to come across a decent venue with people in run by music enthusiasts. Hoorah, and thrice hoorah!',37),(53,'Man, I\'m a lazy sod. Either that or I\'m just tremendously bad at getting gigs. Such a long time since the last one at Chester. First time playing the venerable Wheatsheaf in Oxford though.\r\n\r\nFirst up was Chantel Pike, yet another (and I include me in this) singer / songwriter. However, she marked herself out by having a truly tremendous voice, really world class. I hope she gets some good people around her (not meaning her backing band, the cellist being particularly good) to give her good honest advice, because at the moment you can imagine everyone telling her how great she is, understandably dazzled by her amazing singing. And the fact is while the singing could square up to anyone anywhere quality wise, the songs are not up to that standard. They drift by in an undemanding way, which seems like a terrible waste when paired with a voice superior to any of the Norah Jones / Katie Melua / Amy Winehouse cack going on at the moment. I hope she pairs up with someone strong minded enough to push her, then she\'ll be unbeatable.\r\n\r\nWe were next up to combat against the chatting. Why do people come to gigs to chatter while people play? I\'ve got no beef with people having a natter at the back, around the bar, that kind of thing, after all it\'s a social situation and I\'m just there as entertainment. But last night a whole bunch of people (who I assume were there to see the headline band, since they also talked through Chantel\'s set) sat right at the front and talked in their best loud shouty voices. I mean, shut the fuck up or go somewhere else, eh? Someone else can do the shopping list style who played what aspect of the gig, and give an independent critical view of it. But me and Jase enjoyed it. \r\n\r\nHeadline band Red Star Cycle were pretty cool, having a kind of dEUS thing going with the electric violin and (the high point of the set) bowed saw. Horrah for the bowed saw. Not enough tools in rock. A little prog in their off here, off there song structures as well, which as everyone should know, is alright by me.',38),(54,'As I mentioned on the message board, I\'ve been putting off talking about the Port Mahon show. But might as well get it over with. It started off well - the Port is my favourite venue to play (not that I\'ve done exactly many TSSC gigs) - with Robs, the Ob-Scured main man, up there getting everything organised. Me and Jase set up and soundchecked, running through a couple of new songs, doing a whole bunch of which was my main ambition for the night. Jim and Mark from Toulouse turned up just before doors, and all was relaxed.\r\nA couple of other people turned up to play, I didn\'t see much of the first fella because me and Jase were sorting out some food, but then it was time for a quick blast of the TSSC / Toulouse axis (since I was playing for Toulouse and Jase was playing for both it seemed sensible to mush it all in together). The first set was good, I think, although I can\'t remember that much about it. I had a cold that made singing less satisfying than usual, so I enjoyed walloping my snare drum along with Toulouse more. There were quite a few people there, a bunch of Jim\'s mates, a table full of rude fuckers who talked loudly all the way through everything, and a smattering of TSSC fans. After a half hour of that we made way for someone from \'the table of rude fuckers\' to play for a bit, he sounded a whole hell of a lot better when he was soundchecking than when he actually played. I only saw a bit though, since someone had very politely requested me to play Pull Through, which I\'d never done before, so I spent much of his set on the stairs trying to remember how it went. I played that first in the next set, and then Jim joined in for Same Mistakes. and then... well really it was bad judgement by me in some ways. It was saturday night, people were inebriated, and I think things would have been fine if I\'d played for a while and then Toulouse had finished the whole thing off in rowdy drinking song style. But instead Toulouse played (again, I had a lot of fun doing that), and then some introspective, half-prog navel gazing from me lost the crowd entirely. I started my favourite new song, The Healing, but some nobhead saw fit to yell as loud as possible through the beginning. I fucked up a bit, my voice was still feeling a little difficult to use, so when the next drunk arse shout reverberated around the room I sadly lost my rag, turned off the keyboard and stalked out, pausing only to shout \"WANKER!\" at the oblivious drunk who was still impressing himself with his loudness. Anger swiftly gave way to embarrasment, though, so I hid in the men\'s toilets until everybody had gone, and then packed up and went home. So there you go. I\'m a little ashamed, I\'ve never done anything so unprofessional or prima donna-ish before, but I guess every once in a while it\'s OK. At least it gave me the push I needed to put a full band back together again, so hopefully soon I\'ll be out doing some gigs noisy enough to drown out the chat...',39),(55,'\"How was Sailsbury?\"\r\n\r\nsome may ask.

Possibly something in early \'97, but certainly not after that. That\'s what, 7 years since our last show? We were probably being a little over-confident then, opening up the acoustic stage at Truck on only two rehearsals. It all (well mostly) came flooding back though. It was probably fun, but I was having to concentrate hard on what I was doing just to get through it, so I wasn\'t much of an observer to the whole thing. Good to work with Jason Sherwood again though. His voice is spooky. Actually he\'s quite spooky all over. Builds skate ramps for a living though, which isn\'t at all spooky. Mr. Crosskey enjoyed it, saying it was much more \'dangerous\' (i.e. under-rehearsed, and I didn\'t have a clue what was going to happen next most of the time) than other stuff he\'s seen me doing.',42),(58,'Haven\'t had much time to do diaries. Haven\'t, indeed, got much time to do diaries, so this will be brief. It\'s a little like the joke \"unluckily, the man fell out of the plane... luckily he had a parachute...\" etc. So luckily, I was very kindly offered free time in a friend\'s well appointed studio while his band were away on tour. Unluckily, it happened to fall sqaure in the busiest Dive Dive month ever. I\'ve ben slotting work in when I can, and not sleeping very much, but in the whole month, taking every opportunity, I\'ve only had about 7 or 8 days (or evenings after day job) to work. >>sigh<<. That said, I hope (if today goes as planned) that I will have got everything done that I gave myslef as a minumum, which was to get the drum tracks down for the new album. I kidnapped another friend from another studio, a fantastic engineer who set up a brilliant drum sound for me, hampered only by my insistence on using my full kit (some of the new stuff is very prog, so 6 toms is a must)... I don\'t think he really minded. But the rest has been me wearing a groove in the floor running back and forth between the live room and the control room.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, I\'m going back out there. Must get done, time\'s a-wasting.\r\nBye bye y\'all.',43),(59,'Saudade has been out for a month now (if you\'re reading this and you haven\'t had a listen, feel free to head over to <a href = \"https://open.spotify.com/album/1ziDvxukozqw97XI6C6Hm0?si=XPJ6IkmMS8CkM0hrqlfp9g\" target = \"_blank\">Spotify</a> to listen, or buy it on <a href = \"https://thesadsongco.bandcamp.com/album/saudade\" target = \"_blank\">Bandcamp</a>) so I thought now is the time for the first in a series of blogs putting out and talking about the songs that didn\'t make this, and other, albums. Here, then is the first outtake, from Saudade.\r\n\r\n<!--{a::1::n}-->\r\n\r\nIf you\'ve heard the album you\'ll know there are 4 songs that explore variations on the same theme, and you will likely also immediately recognise that theme the moment this outtake begins. I have no idea why so many mornings (and it was always mornings, before breakfast) I would sit at the piano, play this riff and figure out another way to interpret it. There\'s still another to come as well, in a future instalment.\r\n\r\nFor those prone to even more analysis, you\'ll hear more connections. Sine Qua Non closes the album. The last melodic moments of solo guitar in this are a restatement of one of the themes from that; and of course language students (or Battlestar Galactica fans) will recognise the translation of the Latin term, as paraphrased by Romo Lampkin in the BG episode of the same name. I really responded to the interpretation of the concept as an expression of love and feeling connected to a soul mate. It certainly reflected how I was feeling, and was something I felt compelled to express (mostly) instrumentally.\r\n\r\nIn the end, though, there wasn\'t a place on the album that this short snippet made sense. Though my initial intention was that this would be tacked on to the end of Sine Qua Non, once that track turned out to naturally end with the beginning of Saudade it suggested the cyclical structure of the album, so this track was set adrift. It came down to a choice between this or Makarska Sunset, and that piece won out on the grounds of simplistic beauty.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Good choice? Want to hear more of these tracks-without-a-home? Want to hear me talk more in-depth / disarmingly frankly about album tracks? Let me know in the comments.',44),(60,'Here\'s another tune that didn\'t make an album, this time an outtake from 2018\'s Worth (fact - I had to google that to check the year, I thought it had come out in 2017 but no!).\r\n<!--{i::1::r}-->\r\n<!--{a::1::r}-->\r\nThis is an example of me trying to join together various ideas to try and make a whole song. In no particular order:\r\n\r\n- a demo of multilayered guitar parts in which I was trying to sound like Bloc Party. Spoiler - I didn\'t. The last remaining hint of what that sounded like is in the dying moments of the song, the only place where all 4 guitar parts were momentarily left in. Other than that, the chords became the verse, and I wrote a vocal melody over the top.\r\n- a short piano piece with a melody I found very stirring. That became the chorus, and the latest in a long line of vocal lines that I found wildly hard to sing, since they were written on piano with no consideration for the vagaries of lungs / larynx etc.\r\n- the most complete piece was the middle \'8\' (misnamed obviously, because it\'s waaaaaaay longer than 8 bars), which the rest of the song was built around. It was inspired by the long run of notes that became the basis of the guitar \'solo\' (not really a solo, more of a melody), but I also really loved the bassline - it reminded me of Jah Wobble, particularly his sublime playing on Play Dead by Bjork (<!--{S::1::n}-->), and possibly a little of Tina Weymouth. I adapted it to be the feature that tied all the parts of the song together. Originally written on piano, overall it reminded my of Tori Amos, but a bit balls, hence the working title ToriBalls\r\n\r\nFor some reason I discounted it early enough that I never did a master vocal for it, so the vocal you hear here was recorded early in 2021 - I\'m glad this blog inspired me to finish it.\r\n\r\nI associate the lyrics for this very closely with Islands. The first lines of that and the chorus of this are about the best I\'ve got at romantically expressing the deep love I was experiencing at the time. Feel free to disagree because everyone\'s experience is different, but \"My head is full of lights exposing me, when I\'m with you they\'re all dimmed; I forget myself\" and \"The stars in your eyes makes my walls break, helpless as a baby and naked in front of the world\" really nailed the liberation of my soul that I drew from that profound love, and, in this song, how frightening that could feel. Me being me though I couldn\'t actually write a lyric in either case that stayed happy to the end - in Islands the protagonist ends up shooting themselves in the foot, while in this case it concludes with abandonment. Perhaps it was the negative ending that caused me to decide to leave it off the record.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight perhaps I should have substituted Wounded Lion for this - while I think the opening section of WL is a reall keeper, and the section that follows is very strong, I do feel like it perhaps loses strength as it goes on.

He was, and now is again, drummer for seminal Oxford shoegazers Ride, but has played with all sorts everywhere, including The Jesus And Mary Chain and Gaz Coombes. He played some very early shows with The Sad Song Co., and on one particularly memorable occasion showed in London up for a double drumming version of The Crock with Dive Dive.\r\n\r\n<!--{i::2::r}--> He\'s a lovely chap and no mistaking. Last year, in the midst of the first lockdown, I noticed he was drumming for charity, and dropped him a line saying \"if that happens again, let me know!\". It did, and he did, and now I\'m doing it.\r\n\r\nErrol Kennedy (from UK funkers Imagination) and his wife, singer Bev Sage, organised the first Drumathon last year to support the NHS. This year they\'re doing it again to raise funds for mental health charities, given that the past twelve months has taken quite a toll on people, what with one thing and another. It begins on 15th May at 10am GMT, and a host of drummers will play in a constant relay, most for a very long stint each.\r\n\r\nTo that end I\'m going to be drumming for 12 hours (almost)<!--{f::1::n}--> non-stop, from 10am to 10pm on May 18th. <!--{i::3::l}--> While the sensible advice is apparently to have a 90 min - 3 hour set that you can rotate, I\'ve decided that I\'m going to do a no-repeat chronological journey through my entire career, starting from the very first studio recording I ever made, via school bands, Unbelievable Truth, Dive Dive, Frank Turner, and various other bits and pieces, finally arriving at my most recent Sad Song Co. album Saudade.\r\n\r\nI will post a complete schedule, as accurate as I can<!--{f::2::n}--> here closer to the time, along with some notes and bits and pieces about the tracks.

Go to <a href = \"https://drumathon.live\" target = \"_blank\">drumathon.live</a> for details, but the idea is many drummers (around 50 at the last count) play in a non-stop relay for nearly two weeks of solid drumming, to raise money for mental health charities whose work is sorely needed in the wake of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nI\'m playing for 12 hours, 10am until 10pm, on May 18th, although we\'re playing by Guinness World Record rules, which allows for us 5 minutes off per hour of playing. I\'m intending to a little less than that, but we\'ll see how we go...\r\n\r\nRather than sensibly rotate a set, I\'m doing a no-repeat chronological retrospective of my career. I thought it would be both fun, like album liner notes as they used to be, and helpful, for people to get times for when certain things might be happening if they weren\'t planning on watching THE WHOLE DAMN THING (and why on earth would you?), if I laid out my set, talked a little bit about it and generally provided some companion notes. Anyone who has read the Puritan thread elsewhere on this blog will know some of this already, but this is going to be a bit more song specific. Beware - it\'s long!\r\n\r\nQuick general notes about Drumathon - I\'ve discovered that many songs I\'m involved with I seem happy to leave long sections without drumming. In some instances I have edited out the drumless parts, but when they are still there, I will be playing rudiments on a drum rim to make sure I\'m doing the whole \'non-stop drumming\' thing. The times are if it starts on time and I manage to keep going without stopping for each set, but expect at least some deviation...\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough of all that, on with the endless blog about songs!\r\n\r\n<table id=\"blogTable1\" class=\"blogTable\"><tbody><tr><th id=\"1_1\">10:00 am</th><th id=\"1_2\">1984 - 1989</th><th id=\"1_3\">School band demos</th></tr><tr><td id=\"2_1\">Nightshade</td><td id=\"2_2\">Married Yesterday</td><td id=\"2_3\">This is the first song I ever recorded in a studio (as opposed to recording things at home in some way). My brother needed a drummer for his band, so he convinced our mum to buy me a drumkit. It mutated here and there, but eventually became first vaguely serious school band Nightshade. We played a few shows in the school gym and other places (pictures below), and quite soon started writing our own songs. We recorded this and two other songs over the course of a day in a studio built into someone\'s house in Mottingham, South East London, near our school. I don\'t remember the name of it. It\'s a weirdly tricky thing to play - it\'s always instructive trying to get your head around untutored playing, mine included!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"3_1\" colspan=\"3\"><!--{i::1::c}--></td></tr><tr><td id=\"4_1\">Nightshade</td><td id=\"4_2\">Second Sensation</td><td id=\"4_3\">Another recording session, at the same studio as the first but some months later, with our friend Roger Nunn in his role as producer ameliorating our total lack of studio experience and making it sound a bit better. Drum break straight into the song, lifted from the middle of One For The Vine on Genesis\'s Three Sides Live album</td></tr><tr><td id=\"5_1\" colspan=\"3\"><!--{i::2::c}--></td></tr><tr><td id=\"6_1\" colspan=\"3\"><!--{i::3::c}--></td></tr><tr><td id=\"7_1\">Nightshade</td><td id=\"7_2\">Arctic Summer</td><td id=\"7_3\">Again recorded by Roger Nunn, but this time in my and my brother\'s house, newly arrived as we were in Oxfordshire. I was vaguely beginning to learn something of the value of simplicity, thanks to getting deeply into Jon Farris\'s amazing drumming for INXS, but hadn\'t nailed it yet by any means. This sounds pretty good for a house demo I think, with its overtones of The Cult, and starts the first of a number of recurring themes - that of me adding backing vocal parts to songs that are way too absurdly high for me to sing.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"8_1\">Illiterate Hands</td><td id=\"8_2\">One Little Question</td><td id=\"8_3\">Finally I feel like this is where I start getting a bit serious about what I\'m doing. Finding some like-minded people at my new school in Abingdon and getting into a band with them helped me survive adolescence. It certainly doesn\'t do any harm that I lucked into having Jonny Greenwood as a guitarist (he wrote this song as well) and Andy Yorke as a singer. Blimey - you can hear the tiny seeds of Jonny’s later inimitable guitar playing, and even at this young age I feel like Andy could just sing anything and it immediately sounds just classier - like it\'s a real band. Recorded at the testing studios of local high-end sound console makers SSL, since the father of a friend worked there. We did this and another track in a single day, and I\'m still pretty proud of it, so there.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"9_1\">10:13 am</th><th id=\"9_2\">1990-1991</th><th id=\"9_3\">Purple Rhinos demos and EP <!--{i::4::r}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"10_1\">Purple Rhinos</td><td id=\"10_2\">Blow</td><td id=\"10_3\">Here we are then at my first serious, let\'s push it hard, tour and try and get somewhere band, Purple Rhinos. They grew out of a school band run by Jim Crosskey after he roped in Jason Moulster, wonderful bass player and human who will now crop up pretty regularly for the entire remainder of this drumathon. This was from our first demo, recorded at Dungeon Studios in the Oxfordshire countryside. It got us lots of gigs, and led to a couple of very busy years!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"11_1\">Purple Rhinos</td><td id=\"11_2\">Start</td><td id=\"11_3\">I remember playing the second verse drumbeat of this on my legs once when I was on the loo, and after I noticed what my feet were doing I realised how challenging it was, and couldn\'t do it for a couple of weeks after that. </td></tr><tr><td id=\"12_1\">Purple Rhinos</td><td id=\"12_2\">Once Around The Park</td><td id=\"12_3\">Last song from that first demo. Yeah, Jase is and always has been an incredible and inspiring and original bass player. Whole band was something I was proud of though! Jim was very much the main songwriter, and his dual vocals with Anita were great.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"13_1\">Purple Rhinos</td><td id=\"13_2\">Everything</td><td id=\"13_3\">Lead track from our Simple Life EP, that we put a lot of money and effort into, only to have distribution pulled at the last minute before release, so it never saw the light of day. Probably counts as the first significant drumming challenge of the day - my love of Run To The Hills by Iron Maiden meant I was never shy of trying incredibly fast hi-hat 16th notes in a song, and the verse here is one of the absolute fastest!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"14_1\">Purple Rhinos</td><td id=\"14_2\">Once In A While</td><td id=\"14_3\">Haven\'t got a cowbell, so I\'ll have to make do with twatting the rubber rim of a tom.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"15_1\">Purple Rhinos</td><td id=\"15_2\">Drunk</td><td id=\"15_3\">Last track from the EP, and the Rhinos. I remember walking in to my parent\'s kitchen and Jase and Jim playing the main riff to this and laughing like lunatics. It is one of the most preposterous basslines imaginable, but so catchy. FYI, Jase used to play this live with absolute deadly accuracy, while still smiling broadly, hurling himself around the stage and spending as much time as possible airborne.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"16_1\">10:33 am</th><th id=\"16_2\">1990</th><th id=\"16_3\">On A Friday demos</th></tr><tr><td id=\"17_1\">On A Friday</td><td id=\"17_2\">Climbing Up A Bloody Great Hill</td><td id=\"17_3\">For a few months over the summer of 1990 school friends Jonny, Thom Yorke (older brother of best friend Andy), Jonny\'s brother Colin and Ed O\'Brien were short a drummer while Phil Selway went to Ireland to woo his girlfriend Cate (a good bit of wooing, since they are still married). I stood in, and recorded some demos with them in Clifton Hampden Village Hall. I still enjoy them - they inspired me to some good drumming, it was a really fun time and getting to play with Colin (always the band\'s secret weapon) was a joy. He\'s a funky motherfucker!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"18_1\">On A Friday</td><td id=\"18_2\">Mr B</td><td id=\"18_3\">Epic! Too epic - it had a sensible and conclusive finish, but Mr \"I Like Genesis\" over here suggested bringing it back for one more big rousing unnecessary chorus. Less is more lesson!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"19_1\">On A Friday</td><td id=\"19_2\">Life With The Big F - Keep Strong</td><td id=\"19_3\">Two songs put together, because I always liked how when I mixed these down I made Keep Strong start on a beat so they ran into each other well. Keep Strong was one they\'d been playing with Phil for a while, so I tracked his part pretty closely.<!--{f::1::n}--> I remember recording Thom\'s vocals for Life With The Big F - it finished with him running around the hall where we were recording hollering, which joyous abandon you can still hear on the finished version.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"20_1\">10:47 am</th><th id=\"20_2\">1994 - 1996</th><th id=\"20_3\">Random Demos</th></tr><tr><td id=\"21_1\">Leslie Orinick</td><td id=\"21_2\">Up \'n\' Ready</td><td id=\"21_3\">After spending a couple of years on the road as Radiohead\'s lighting designer I got back into being Nigel The Drummer again. As always saying yes to everything, a friend was doing a pop rock demo, and I contributed drums, bass and keyboards, again recording at Dungeon. Guitars were added on another day by Marcus Flynn, who I ended up working with in a teaching capacity many years later. I enjoyed this, and still do! It\'s pretty unashamed, and there\'s nowt wrong with that.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"22_1\">The Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"22_2\">Sharing</td><td id=\"22_3\">The stylistic whiplash between the previous track and this one made me chuckle first time I played through this set. This was the first demo of the nascent band we put together to play songs that Andy Yorke had written in Moscow during his time there. Only Jase seemed artistically appropriate, so the band was only the three of us, but since we weren\'t strong enough in the guitar department at this point I asked Jonny to contribute some guitar. We were trying very hard to be like Throwing Muses initially, hence my doing my best David Narcizo impression on my early 90s electric drums.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"23_1\">Groove</td><td id=\"23_2\">Pretty Bird</td><td id=\"23_3\">Friend, sound engineer and excellent bassist Andy Shillito recommended me to Groove, a wistfully charming chap from Balham with quite the Bowie obsession. We recorded this in Island Record\'s basement studios, and it continues to chart my course to the world of simplicity.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"24_1\">Groove</td><td id=\"24_2\">Shock Treatment</td><td id=\"24_3\">After Andy Yorke decided he didn\'t want to pursue The Unbelievable Truth I worked more with Groove. Andy Shillito had moved on, so of course, I roped Jase in to play bass. So much music I have played with this beautiful and talented man. Jim from Purple Rhinos also ended up playing for Groove as well, but I don\'t *think* he\'s on this recording. I always really rated this song, and it uses some hi-hat foot tricks that I\'ve employed many times since.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"25_1\">11:02 am</th><th id=\"25_2\">1997 - 1998</th><th id=\"25_3\">Unbelievable Truth - Almost Here and b-sides <!--{i::5::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"26_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"26_2\">Too Many Things To Learn</td><td id=\"26_3\">Trying to keep it strictly chronological, this was the b-side of our first release, a slightly extended version of Building released on Oxford\'s Shifty Disco label. both recorded on 8-track in my house. I\'m pretty amazed I managed to record acoustic drums in a flat without being killed by any neighbours. Perhaps underlined my desire to try and get drums down in one or at most two takes.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"27_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"27_2\">Solved</td><td id=\"27_3\">Andy came back from another trip to Russia and decided to give music another go. We signed to Virgin Records and recorded and released this album, with me producing as well as providing drums, keyboards, guitars and backing vocals. It remains my proudest piece of work. There is something we captured in the atmosphere that still gives me shivers. This was the third single, second top 40, re-recorded from a 1996 demo. Jase and I wrote it in my dad\'s house in about the amount of time it takes to play it.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"28_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"28_2\">Angel</td><td id=\"28_3\">I later on re-used exactly this drum part for the live version of Wisdom Teeth. I am particularly proud of the string arrangement on this song.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"29_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"29_2\">Stone</td><td id=\"29_3\">The first single released from the record. The first of the new batch I remember Andy coming back with.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"30_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"30_2\">From This Height</td><td id=\"30_3\">Extra track for the Japanese release of the album. Andy always loved the hell out of this song and still does, and I can\'t say I disagree with him. I think possibly we left it off the album (there was a lot of good material and not enough space) because we recorded it a little too slow. Not. Quite. My. Tempo.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"31_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"31_2\">Same Mistakes</td><td id=\"31_3\">Another from UT mk 1, I remember playing this at our acoustic shows from back then. Showcased our secret weapon, which was ebbing and flowing dynamics. The way it surges from quiet to loud and back again always reminded me of the ocean.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"32_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"32_2\">Forget About Me</td><td id=\"32_3\">More dynamics. One of the last mk 1 songs we wrote. I\'m still a touch disappointed that this recorded version isn\'t quite perfect (there\'s a gap that should be a bit longer but I made a miscalculation on a metronome). Still moves me all the same though.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"33_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"33_2\">Settle Down</td><td id=\"33_3\">4th single from the record, 3rd top 40. Love the backing vocals in this, and for a drummer it\'s not a bad guitar solo.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"34_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"34_2\">Finest Little Space</td><td id=\"34_3\">The first of two demos from mk1 time that we used for that album. We re-recorded the vocals, but the rest is what we recorded in 96. </td></tr><tr><td id=\"35_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"35_2\">Building</td><td id=\"35_3\">I think writing this song, a truly collaborative and blissfully telepathic experience, was one of the things that convinced Andy to really give it another try. A riff and some chords from Jase, a beautiful melody from Andy, a middle 8 and structure from me, and it just seemed to work.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"36_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"36_2\">Higher Than Reason</td><td id=\"36_3\">2nd single and first top 40, which was exciting. Also a demo from 96. Possibly we even kept the vocals? I added electric and acoustic guitars to the slightly manic Jase guitar riff, which I played directly into the mastering session.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"37_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"37_2\">Be Ready</td><td id=\"37_3\">Drums recorded slow so they\'d be sped up and tiny sounding when bringing the speed back to normal. When I practiced playing this for drumathon (and bear in mind I haven\'t played these songs at all in a couple of decades) it made me quite emotional.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"38_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"38_2\">Tyre Tracks</td><td id=\"38_3\">Stone b-side. Lots of percussion-y bits and pieces. I think I was trying to recreate some of the feeling of PJ Harvey\'s album To Bring You My Love. Managed to do percussion and drums all together live, which you will witness on the Drumathon live stream!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"39_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"39_2\">Who\'s To Know</td><td id=\"39_3\">B-side of the Higher Than Reason single. <!--{f::2::n}--> Like From This Height, another tough one to leave off the record, although the recorded version never quite had the power it did live. I\'ll be playing it more like the concert version.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"40_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"40_2\">Coming \'Round</td><td id=\"40_3\">B-side of the Higher Than Reason single.Never played this live, but I have a real affection for it. I suppose I would - it\'s Phil Collins drumming over a Jase bassline and a beautiful Andy melody, that explodes into another string arrangement that made me proud. Going to enjoy playing this one!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"41_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"41_2\">Revolution</td><td id=\"41_3\">B-side of the Higher Than Reason single. A failure of production perhaps, this song never reached its potential. In an alternate universe it probably should have been the big single from the record, but I didn\'t properly solve the structure until later live versions, and the arrangement was a bit too constrained and polite. Great song though! Bravo Andy!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"42_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"42_2\">Yesterday Never Leaves</td><td id=\"42_3\">B-side of the Solved single. Drums recorded straight to stereo in the rehearsal room we were using to get ready for tour. The most latin we ever got. More strings! I clearly had a thing about them at the time.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"43_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"43_2\">There If You Want It</td><td id=\"43_3\">B-side of the Solved single, same drum recording session as Yesterday Never Leaves. Trying to prove that we can \'rock\', in a gentle REM kind of way. Hammer that piano!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"44_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"44_2\">Dune Sea</td><td id=\"44_3\">Double-A side with Settle Down, drums as the last two. This is the only UT song I\'ve felt confident to play solo since. Nice mournful violin from Sharon Warnes. I have a nice version of this from a BBC Radio 1 session for Steve Lamacq.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"45_1\">12:15 pm</th><th id=\"45_2\">2000</th><th id=\"45_3\">sorrythankyou album <!--{i::6::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"46_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"46_2\">Landslide</td><td id=\"46_3\">Opening track from Almost Here follow up. Big sounding concert tom kit!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"47_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"47_2\">A Name</td><td id=\"47_3\">More stylistic whiplash - straight from the previous bombast into the smallest, dryest kick snare and ride I could muster. I like this song. I should probably play it myself. It\'s one of the few UT songs where I wrote all of it except the lyrics - I had some of them, including the opening and \'I have to know a name\' line, but Andy completed it for me in a way more satisfactorily than I ever could have done.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"48_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"48_2\">Disarm</td><td id=\"48_3\">Snares off, back to the concert tom kit in a more subdued way. Phil Vinall who mixed this album described this as the best recorded drumkit he\'d worked on, which is testament to the work of engineer and co-producer Jim Warren.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"49_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"49_2\">Pedestrian</td><td id=\"49_3\">I really was determined to have some rhythmic variety on this album, wasn\'t I? This time, just one 18\" concert tom and a snare, with some overdubs of the tom for that Kings Of The Wild Frontier vibe. You can hear a microphone that was being punished by the amount of air the tom was moving breaking midway through the piano break.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"50_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"50_2\">Home Again</td><td id=\"50_3\">Still haven\'t used the same kit twice on this album. This was actually my Roland V-Drums kit (the original TD10) recorded in the cottage where we wrote and did pre-production on this album. I liked the brush sound on it. No brushes on my current electronic drum module, so I\'ll just have to play quietly...</td></tr><tr><td id=\"51_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"51_2\">Daylight</td><td id=\"51_3\">Also recorded at the cottage, piecemeal - a kick drum lain on the floor played with a towel wrapped around a cymbal mallet, a snare recorded using a microphone from the other end of the hall, and ending with a tiny drumkit recorded by one microphone in a bucket (empty, thankfully). Can\'t reproduce that with all my modern technology either, so I\'ll just have to make do.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"52_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"52_2\">Advice To A Lover</td><td id=\"52_3\">I overcomplicated the drum part on this, and Phil Vinall stripped it back as best he could in the mix. I\'ll play what I probably should have played. Lovely bass playing (as always) by Jase, I based the string arrangement mostly around what he was doing.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"53_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"53_2\">Agony</td><td id=\"53_3\">Jim Warren\'s vintage Ludwig kit here, with an aggressive snare and floor tom overdub. I feel I got a bit overwrought trying to prove versatility on this album... Fun song though, especially live. Andy\'s voice could communicate disappointed aggression when he wanted it to.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"54_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"54_2\">Covers</td><td id=\"54_3\">Written at the tail end of UT mk1, recorded in my flat (this time with very quiet brushes to avoid neighbour annoyance). We ended up using the demo for the album pretty much verbatim.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"55_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"55_2\">I Can\'t Wait</td><td id=\"55_3\">Played as a band in the studio, with a rare recording appearance by live guitarist Jim Crosskey, from Purple Rhinos (see an hour ago). Trying to express Andy and my obsession with I Want You by Elvis Costello And The Attractions. I added the keyboards after, in one take as I recall. We tried to keep it as live feeling as possible, hence me now being slightly embarrassed by some of the inaccuracies in the drum playing.</td></tr><tr><th id=\"56_1\">12:54 pm</th><th id=\"56_2\">2001</th><th id=\"56_3\">Misc.

That was a busy day. I played bass on this as well, since I had more of a feel for the rhythmic aggression (Jase is just too nice a human). Andy already writing lyrics about wanting to leave the band at this point...</td></tr><tr><td id=\"58_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"58_2\">Roadside # 2</td><td id=\"58_3\">More rehearsal room drums. There is a Roadside # 1, which was just piano and vocal, one of our earliest songs. I\'ve never been happy with the mix of this one - the backing vocals I remember from the rough version were enormous and C, S, N &amp; Y evocative, but they get buried here.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"59_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"59_2\">Believe In Anger</td><td id=\"59_3\">There was a lot of me playing a keyboard from a drum pad while Jase twisted knobs to change the sound on this one. Drum wise it\'s a peculiar mix of very straightforward (I love wilful simplicity) and jazzy.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"60_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"60_2\">Nightlight</td><td id=\"60_3\">One of my favourite songs from this era. Drums sound programmed but were in fact all played off my V-Drums. It\'ll sound very odd on acoustic drums, but it\'ll have to do for drumathon.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"61_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"61_2\">History - Fiction</td><td id=\"61_3\">Rehearsal room drums, string quartet, old song. Was always going to be a b-side I think, but I like it all the same - very REM-y</td></tr><tr><td id=\"62_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"62_2\">Ciao! My Shining Star</td><td id=\"62_3\">Mark Mulcahy cover that we used to do regularly, this recording is from our show at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London in 1998, with some keyboard overdubs in 2001 while I was mixing and preparing the compilation release.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"63_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"63_2\">All This Time</td><td id=\"63_3\">Jim Crosskey on geeetaaaaarr! I\'m also very fond of my guitar riff that kicks this off, I find myself playing it idly when I pick up an acoustic.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"64_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"64_2\">Heaven Sent Me</td><td id=\"64_3\">I always thought this sounded like a single, but it never even made it on the album. So what do I know? Some Robert Ellis-esque drumming in the chorus. He\'s one of my favourite players ever.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"65_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"65_2\">Everyone Has To Eat</td><td id=\"65_3\">ANOTHER track from the day in the rehearsal room. Jeez! I mixed this track during the sessions for sorrythankyou when Phil Vinall disappeared for a few days. I\'m pretty pleased with how it came out!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"66_1\">Unbelievable Truth</td><td id=\"66_2\">Disaster</td><td id=\"66_3\">An epic final song for Unbelievable Truth to bow out on. Full of myself perhaps, but I\'m so very proud of what we did, and that a song like this was a b-side I think speaks to our quality control levels. </td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\nAnd that concludes the first set!

The versions I\'m drumming on here are from the 2020 remix. First odd time signature of the day, a loping 7/4 beat that I enjoy playing. This was one of the first songs written for the album, trying to fuse indie guitar music with some prog rock ideas. Jase is on bass throughout this album. OF COURSE.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"3_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"3_2\">Ghosts</td><td id=\"3_3\">I have no idea what the chords are to this song anymore. None. They\'re all weird and just off normal, and played on a 12 string guitar. No Jase here, because all the bass is from a Taurus-like sound - I was trying to make the arrangement a bit like Squonk by Genesis.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"4_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"4_2\">Blind Man</td><td id=\"4_3\">Played on my beloved V-Drums that I bought back in \'98 or \'99. In fact, if you\'re watching the video, it\'s the same pads, though a new sound source. Jase\'s work is phenomenal on this. We\'d borrowed Jonny Greenwood\'s Digitech Whammy pedal, and Jase got all over excited running his bass through it and making weird noises and riffs, that I then cut up into a kind of rhythmic bed for the song.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"5_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"5_2\">Pleasure Babies</td><td id=\"5_3\">I\'m anticipating playing this better now than I did on the record. I was never really happy with the recording.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"6_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"6_2\">The Everlasting Mile</td><td id=\"6_3\">The album version is cut up and looped bits of me playing acoustic drums, recorded by Jamie Stuart and Tarrant Anderson from Dive Dive (who I was involved with by this point) at Tarrant\'s house in Oxford. I\'ll be a bit looser with it today. Especially since I\'ve been drumming for nigh on 4 hours by this point...</td></tr><tr><td id=\"7_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"7_2\">Deep Cover</td><td id=\"7_3\">Nice guitar solo by old friend Ken Turner. The intricate guitar riff that started this song never seemed to sit happily in the world of ROCK, but the 2020 version brought out a better idea of what this song should be.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"8_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"8_2\">Into The Hills</td><td id=\"8_3\">Original version was kick, snare and a crash cymbal recorded in my flat, annoying my long suffering neighbours. Hoping to improve on that today. And man, I know I\'m getting repetitive, but I love creating songs with Jase.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"9_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"9_2\">This Isn\'t What I Expected</td><td id=\"9_3\">Most of this is originally a loop, so I\'ll have to improvise a bit rather than just sit looking stupid.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"10_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"10_2\">Gulag Parenting</td><td id=\"10_3\">Loz Colbert, who got me involved in Drumathon this year, essentially wrote the drum part for this, at a very early rehearsal I did for TSSC. Took it a way I wouldn\'t have thought, kind of tribal. Thanks Loz! Maybe in an alternative universe TSSC would have been a proper band. I would have liked that.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"11_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"11_2\">You Get My Best</td><td id=\"11_3\">Minimal, slowly building drumming. And we clearly still had Jonny\'s Whammy pedal to hand for the bass guitar. You can hear my beloved Premier Genista concert tom kit in full effect here.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"12_1\">2:24 pm</th><th id=\"12_2\">2005</th><th id=\"12_3\">Tilting At Windmills - debut Dive Dive album <!--{i::2::c}--></th></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td id=\"13_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"13_2\">Good Show</td><td id=\"13_3\">4 hours in and NOW things start getting challenging. I had joined Dive Dive in 2001, and we had gigged an awful lot and released a few EPs, singles and such, but this was our debut album. Jamie\'s downright amazing songwriting was always inspiring to me, and he had a superb and off-kilter rhythmic sense that I totally gelled with, and Tarrant\'s propulsive bass playing always drove me to very satisfying levels of inventiveness in serving the song. While Jase was unequalled at creating beauty, I can\'t deny the chemistry in the DD rhythm section (which really included Jamie as well, since he used his guitar like a drum so often). This is big, and poppy, and slightly bitter.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"14_1\">Dive Dive </td><td id=\"14_2\">Modern Man</td><td id=\"14_3\">It\'s been a real pleasure revisiting these albums. Even if I wasn\'t in the band, I would listen the fuck out of these records. This has something I can\'t reproduce for Drumathon - I always liked to try and find different bits of the drumkit to hit, and the middle 8 of this includes the hi hat stand and (I think) the top of the kick drum. This isn\'t something electric kits are any good at. Also - I love the way Jamie and my voices work together.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"15_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"15_2\">The Sorry Suitor</td><td id=\"15_3\">The beginning of my yen for putting stuff on my floor tom. There was a small set of sleigh bells hanging around, so the distinctive sound of the song (and my main urge is always for distinctiveness) was my floor tom hit with a soft cymbal beater while the sleigh bells rattle around. Again, not something an electric kit can readily reproduce.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"16_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"16_2\">Name And Number</td><td id=\"16_3\">I mean, are you kidding? This many hours in and I have to play this? It was so much fun live, but then we were a really great live band, something that only increased as our inter-band chemistry and intuitiveness increased. This has one of the hardest bits I remember of our sets - the end of the bridge being a snare roll at absolute maximum volume all played as rimshots, dropping in an instant to a quiet, almost jazzy start to the chorus. Dustball (as they were before I joined and we later became Dive Dive) already had a good grasp of dynamics, but I think I came in and took it as extreme as it could go.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"17_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"17_2\">Rockability</td><td id=\"17_3\">Electronic drum fail again - the verses involve a lot of hand damping of a tiny bell cymbal for effect sounds. More excellent dynamics in the middle 8 as well.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"18_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"18_2\">Sire</td><td id=\"18_3\">For the album I played this on an African drum my aunt had brought back from her missionary work in the 1960s and subsequently gifted to my parents. Live, I played it with beaters on drums which I draped towels over. Come on, electronic drum kit! You\'re not even trying to keep up! I also contributed piano and glockenspiel to this, in my role as player of the minimal amounts of keyboards on Dive Dive records.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"19_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"19_2\">Throw Me Off The Plane</td><td id=\"19_3\">I considered leaving this out of the setlist, since I didn\'t know if I\'d be able to manage it by this point of proceedings. Canny readers will have noticed I quietly dropped Uberdrums, because, well, I just couldn\'t play it anymore. But nothing ventured nothing gained, this breakneck mania is staying in. Watch a grown man cry!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"20_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"20_2\">5-5-5 For Filmstars</td><td id=\"20_3\">Like the tiny snare overdubs on this. Every one of these songs brings back a slew of great memories of playing live. The video for this one is pretty good too!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"21_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"21_2\">Sounds All Wrong</td><td id=\"21_3\">On running through these things to make sure I remembered them, I thought this one would be a breeze, given how it\'s pretty simple in comparison to some of the others. However it wasn\'t quite so straightforward - I always try and compose drum parts so the detail becomes part of the song, and getting bits and pieces out of place made this feel weird. I\'ll do my best. Don\'t sue me. Go and donate to Drumathon instead!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"22_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"22_2\">Det Got Ingentin</td><td id=\"22_3\">Title is Swedish. Played the floor tom with a maraca in the studio and live, so I\'ll do the same today, although it doesn\'t have quite the same feel on an electric kit. This sounds astonishingly like a Fugazi song, but I didn\'t hear it until a good decade or so later. I guess we were drawing from the same well.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"23_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"23_2\">Lying\'s What We\'re Here For</td><td id=\"23_3\">We used to finish our albums with a more downbeat song. No idea why, it just felt right. Like the arrangement on this, particularly the disconcerting metric modulation in the middle 8 that then lurches back into the original tempo. Nice. Only band I\'ve played with that I felt could really pull stuff like that off without it feeling clever, and always having it serve the song. Live we always finished with The Crock Of Revolter which was a hidden track on this album (we did with two drummers a few times, particularly memorably with Loz Colbert in London) but I ain\'t playing that. (Because I don\'t seem to have a copy of it)</td></tr><tr><td id=\"24_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"24_2\">If The Crash Doesn\'t Get You Then The Smoke Will</td><td id=\"24_3\">Left off the album, but I was always pretty fond of this song. Anyone remember if we ever played it live? Weird ol\' keyboard part in the middle there - I *think* I wrote it as a guitar part, but we decided it worked better with me playing it on keyboard.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"25_1\">3:05 pm</th><th id=\"25_2\">2006</th><th id=\"25_3\">Milow - The Bigger Picture album <!--{i::3::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"26_1\">Milow</td><td id=\"26_2\">Landslide</td><td id=\"26_3\">In 2005 young Belgian singer-songwriter Jonathan Vandenbroek contacted me about producing his debut album. It was self-financed, so we did a lot of preparation in my flat (howdy neighbours!) before heading to a studio near Ghent for a breakneck 7 days to record and mix the whole thing from scratch. You can read more about the process <a href=\"https://thesadsongco.com/?page=blog#blog_id=26\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, but for the first time since 2006, and the first time ever in public, here I am playing along to the songs. First up, the second song today called Landslide, leaning into simplicity clearly. I don\'t think I really nailed the drum sound, not to my satisfaction, but I am very fond of my work on this record.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"27_1\">Milow</td><td id=\"27_2\">Stepping Stone</td><td id=\"27_3\">Back in Unbelievable Truth days, we had an American called David Poe supporting us on a UK tour, and his drummer at the time was Sim Cain, who had done many things including The Rollins Band, and who I found very inspiring. He introduced me properly to playing with brushes, and the way I played this song was very much inspired by him. The e-drums I have can\'t do brush sweeps or anything like it, so I will essentially be \'miming\' those with sticks. It\'s gonna sound a bit ugly, but I don\'t want to leave this song out, and man\'s gotta play for 12 hours! Not drumming related, but once again I enjoyed doing string arrangements for this record, and this is one of those, recorded through a thing called a Binaural Head.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"28_1\">Milow</td><td id=\"28_2\">Excuse To Try</td><td id=\"28_3\">As a producer I did doo my best to help provide a \'single\', but that kind of commercially minded stuff is not my strong suit. I thought this one would be a candidate, and tried to approach it as such. The album went gold in Belgium and paved the way for Europe-wide success, but he needed to re-record another song on the record in order to get something that radio could really latch onto. That\'s ok though. I\'m ok with my limitations. Particularly when...</td></tr><tr><td id=\"29_1\">Milow</td><td id=\"29_2\">Until The Morning Comes</td><td id=\"29_3\">... I can make stuff like this. It\'s my favourite on the album (and I think Jonathan\'s too - I believe it is still a regular part of his live set 15 years later). Snares off, beaters on the toms, adding momentum with the hi-hat foot, and producing a really lovely atmosphere, this is the kind of stuff I felt much more at home with, and I think it shows. I had been getting into low monk-like backing vocals as well, and some of those get a look in too.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"30_1\">3:23 pm</th><th id=\"30_2\">2006 - 2007</th><th id=\"30_3\">Campfire Punkrock E.P / Sleep Is For The Week album <!--{i::4::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"31_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"31_2\">The Real Damage (section)</td><td id=\"31_3\">Things get distinctly busy from here on in. At the time I was working a 0.8 job teaching on a National Diploma in music at a college of FE in Oxford, raising a young family, working part time at the reopened Zodiac (by this time the Oxford O2 Academy) doing lights, and touring with Dive Dive and from January 2007 Frank Turner. Dive Dive and Frank had crossed paths on our Tilting At Windmills tour in 2005, and we had offered to help him out by being his band and recording partners for his notional new solo venture. I\'ll get more into it in specific songs as we go, but a note on recordings - I didn\'t have separate tracks for the album so these versions are live, taken from our complete performance of SiftW at the first Lost Evenings (I used to take the master multitracks and spend some time doing a good mix for the band to listen back to, and hopefully feel proud of). So here we go!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"32_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"32_2\">Vital Signs</td><td id=\"32_3\">While Frank\'s debut EP (which we\'ll get to shortly) featured Tarrant, Ben and myself as the band, most of his debut album was just me and Frank. We figured out arrangements over a couple of days in Tarrant\'s basement, and then I recorded all the drums for the album, again over a couple of days, for Frank to layer guitars and basses onto. I came back later to add piano and organ. At this point I was still using the DD kit, which meant no toms, just one floor tom. It\'s good to give yourself restrictions to work around sometimes.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"33_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"33_2\">This Town Ain\'t Big Enough For The One Of Me</td><td id=\"33_3\">This is from his first solo release, the Campfire Punk Rock E.P. I always liked the uncynical Dive Dive attitude. We did this EP and the first tour with Frank unpaid (I asked for a bit for the album recording sessions) with the unspoken understanding that by committing early there would be some loyalty, and sharing in later good fortune made possible by us not being breadheads from the word go. Frank initially said he had his head turned hearing me play the intro to Rock And Roll by Led Zeppelin, so when we were trying to figure out an intro to get into this song I suggested I played that, but as a shuffle. Which is not the easiest thing in the world...</td></tr><tr><td id=\"34_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"34_2\">Romantic Fatigue</td><td id=\"34_3\">More e-drums not keeping up with my drum parts, there\'s more sweepy brush work at the start of this song before a quickchange to sticks. I\'ll mime it again...</td></tr><tr><td id=\"35_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"35_2\">Once We Were Anarchists</td><td id=\"35_3\">While it didn\'t apply to the album version, live I think FT having the ready-made chemistry that we\'d developed in Dive Dive was a big contributor to those early shows pushing his brand forward. With the addition of Matt you can hear that here - the indefinable thing that makes a band who\'ve worked together for a long time amplify everything about a performance of a song.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"36_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"36_2\">Back In The Day</td><td id=\"36_3\">Early frantic punk workout. I was trying to invoke Violent Femmes with what I was playing. The album (and live) versions used Hot Rods (bundles of thin dowels strapped together to give a sound halfway between a brush and a stick), but not an option with e-drums, so live with it. The interaction between Tarrant and I here is a joy.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"37_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"37_2\">My Kingdom For A Horse</td><td id=\"37_3\">This kind of stuff was perhaps more in my wheelhouse. Another of my high backing vocals as well.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"38_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"38_2\">Wisdom Teeth</td><td id=\"38_3\">This was acoustic on the album, but it was band-ed up quite soon after. I lifted the drumbeat from Unbelievable Truth song Angel, waste not want not. Timing the BV and the drums in the middle 8 was always a partial brain melter.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"39_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"39_2\">Smiling At Strangers On Trains</td><td id=\"39_3\">Old Million Dead song that we rearranged and incorporated into the FT set.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"40_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"40_2\">Nashville, Tennessee</td><td id=\"40_3\">As the first song on Frank\'s first full solo release, the way Frank, Ben, Tarrant and I crash into this was a true statement of intent. It survived in the set much longer than anything else from that period.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"41_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"41_2\">Ladies Of London Town</td><td id=\"41_3\">Jonny once told me that once Radiohead had recorded a pile of material for an album they tried to play \'spot the Electioneering\' (the track that doesn\'t quite measure up quality-wise). I think in the Frank Turner world this would have been called \'spot the Ladies Of London Town\'.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"42_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"42_2\">Must Try Harder</td><td id=\"42_3\">Another example of how I like to find the subtle precision in a drum arrangement such that you don\'t really notice, but it weaves itself into the song that when it\'s different it just feels off. The first half is a willed choice for every kick drum and cross stick, an invisible scaffold to underpin the stuff that people are actively listening to. Good BVs at the end too.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"43_1\">Frank Turner</td><td id=\"43_2\">Father\'s Day</td><td id=\"43_3\">Fun version with Anna Jenkins on violin.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"44_1\">4:05 pm</th><th id=\"44_2\">2007</th><th id=\"44_3\">The Sad Song Co. - Poignant Device album <!--{i::5::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"45_1\">The Sad Song Co. </td><td id=\"45_2\">Face Down In The Pool</td><td id=\"45_3\">I had actually mostly recorded this album in 2005, but hadn\'t the state of mind of confidence to complete and release it until 2007. It\'s still my least favourite of my solo albums, although I know some people really like it. It\'s the most self-reflexively \'prog rock\', which is why this track has the long harmonising arpeggiating acoustic guitars of the intro cut out so we can get straight to where the drums begin. The guitar and drums under the keyboard solo reference a band called Intentions Of An Asteroid that Dive Dive had played with.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"46_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"46_2\">I Love Joy</td><td id=\"46_3\">Much simpler and more REM-y. I grabbed a bit of an uncompleted Unbelievable Truth song for the rousing key change section. Which is why it has such a nice melody, because it came from Andy Yorke. Oh, btw, didn\'t mention on the last song, but of course Jase\'s lovely bass playing is in full effect here.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"47_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"47_2\">Dressing Down</td><td id=\"47_3\">Guitar solo was from the demo and I knew I\'d never be able to recreate it. In its full version this song is probably the one I\'m fondest of on the record.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"48_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"48_2\">Rescue</td><td id=\"48_3\">Jase on bass guitar and acoustic guitar on this song. In fact, he wrote most of it. Isn\'t it gorgeous? Something I love about doing this drumathon thing is that I\'ve never actually got to play along with Jase on this (I recorded the drums first, accompanied only by the imagined music in my head), but now I get to groove with him. I am very happy about that!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"49_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"49_2\">The Healing</td><td id=\"49_3\">A song of mine that mostly predates Unbelievable Truth. I\'m pretty happy with the guitar melody / solo in this as well. I\'m not a natural guitarist, especially with a slide. And did I mention how ace Jase is?</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"50_1\">4:26 pm</th><th id=\"50_2\">2007</th><th id=\"50_3\">Dive Dive - The Revenge Of The Mechanical Dog album <!--{i::6::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"51_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"51_2\">Let The Blind Lead The Blind</td><td id=\"51_3\">So, I\'m like 6 hours into this Drumathon and you expect me to play this? Oh jeez. Once again my predilection for extremely fast hi hat 16ths returns on the opening track of my third album release of 2007. I was always a bit down on this album because production and mix wise it doesn\'t quite match the rest of the DD catalogue, but coming back to it to remind myself how the drum parts go for Drumathon has reminded me that it really does have a lot of great songs on. </td></tr><tr><td id=\"52_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"52_2\">The Game</td><td id=\"52_3\">I like finding other things to do with my hands when drumming other than just twatting things with a piece of wood. For the first half the high end of this track comes from a tambourine. Clearly I\'m going to have to set a microphone up to capture these various peccadilloes. Good video for this song, made for 40p by our good friend Jon Spira. Odd time signature alert in the middle 8. What the deuce? Wasn\'t my fault this time I think. Jamie has a penchant for that kind of thing.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"53_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"53_2\">Cuts And Bruises</td><td id=\"53_3\">I remember demoing this for a major record label in London somewhere. We never got a deal with them, clearly. I like the verses here - very weirdly groovy and danceable, if you have a damaged hip of some sort. Jamie\'s (always excellent) lyrics are somewhat inscrutable, but it sounds like this deals with disaffection with the whole business of being in a band.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"54_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"54_2\">Seven Of Eight</td><td id=\"54_3\">The title is a Star Trek: Voyager reference, but it\'s also inaccurate because the verse is IN SEVEN FOUR! GODDDDDDD! What the shitting crikey is going on in the middle 8 is anyone\'s guess (bar of 9, bar of 10, bar of 7 perhaps?). Not my fault again, blame Jamie. I like how the second time around I just give up and play straight over the whole thing. \"Screw you guys, I\'ll meet you at the start of the next chorus\".</td></tr><tr><td id=\"55_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"55_2\">Maybe I\'m Ok</td><td id=\"55_3\">Love this track, and it typifies Dive Dive, and how I fitted in. Could have played straight across Jamie\'s weird riff, but I felt like it would have undermined it, and I always want to serve the song. So instead I follow it rhythmically, making the whole thing feel rocking, but also like it might topple over all the time. Then when it straightens out for the chorus it\'s an excellent bit of songwriting and arrangement working as one - tension and release, which is what it\'s all about for the listener.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"56_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"56_2\">Holding Back The Broken Door</td><td id=\"56_3\">An example of how striving for what feels right I can make life tough for myself. The feel when we wrote it seemed obvious - do do DAH DAH do do DAH DAH - but I wanted something to make it distinct, and the rims on the \'do do\' s were good. However, it only charmed me when it was both hands slightly flamming them, so the verses became very fast relentless constant 8th notes on both hands moving between rims and drums. Tough live, who knows if I\'ll be able to do it 7 hours into a drum marathon. Plus the fact you won\'t be able to hear the floor tom rim anyway (because my drum pads are old and don\'t have rim triggers on the toms), so I\'m just hurting myself trying to do it authentically.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"57_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"57_2\">Take It, It\'s Yours</td><td id=\"57_3\">A slight respite perhaps? Wilful simplicity, with some tricksy subtleties on the hi hat foot. It\'s the (sometimes tricksy, always precise) subtleties, which I fully believe most regular listeners don\'t consciously hear, that give songs identity and make them SUB-consciously stand out. Trying to find that drives me.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"58_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"58_2\">Talentless Fucks</td><td id=\"58_3\">A holdover from the Tilting At Windmills recording sessions that we finished off for this album. More hitting things with items other than sticks (maracas in this case). And some actual organ over the outro. It was always good having a keyboardist in the band who could add bits and pieces when needed, without there being some kind of obligation to always have keyboards doing something to keep a band member happy.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"59_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"59_2\">Clarence Bodiker</td><td id=\"59_3\">Another preference I have when trying to find drum arrangements is one \'thing\' that I can do throughout a song with slight variations, instead of wandering about all over the map. This goes some way towards that, with only the intro and the middle 8 deviating from the driving 8th notes on the kick drum with a flammed snare feel that ties the rest of it together.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"60_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"60_2\">Perfectly Pathetic</td><td id=\"60_3\">There hasn\'t been too much (or any?) double kick work thus far in the recorded career. Most of the \'accepted\' ways of using a double pedal didn\'t sound attractive to me. I use it here though - I enjoy things when an original challenge occurs to me. For this song it was to play the kick as quietly as possible, so the verses sound liked they\'re backed by the manic beating heart of a rabbit. Another \'identity\' detail - doubling up the chorus kick drums with the floor tom. A lot of effort, but it\'s another of those things that I hope no audience member will actually consciously hear, but if you play the song without it something just feels off, and not quite right.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"61_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"61_2\">This Ain\'t Jetplane</td><td id=\"61_3\">The title is a combination of two bands we were criss-crossing  with on the road at the time, This Ain\'t Vegas and Jetplane Landing (featuring Cahir O\'Doherty). Like Maybe I\'m OK, it employs the tension - release technique of a \"where\'s the one?\"<!--{f::1::n}--> verse exploding into a much straighter chorus. I really rate Jamie\'s lyric writing. I\'ve heard a lot of songs about the pointlessness of war sound hackneyed and embarrassing, but he always seems to find an original and meaningful way to express himself</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"62_1\">5:03 pm</th><th id=\"62_2\">2008</th><th id=\"62_3\">Frank Turner - Love, Ire & Song album <!--{i::7::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"63_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"63_2\">Photosynthesis</td><td id=\"63_3\">While a number of the songs for FT\'s second effort had been played in by the live band on the tours in 2007 for the album it was mostly just me and him again, with Ben producing. I came in for a couple of days and laid down the drums for all the tracks, and came back a week or so later to play the keyboards. Like SiftW, I didn\'t have stems for this album so these versions are taken from the live recording of our London O2 Arena headline in 2014, which I don\'t mind since by this time the excellent chemistry of the band had elevated already great material to new heights. We opened the set with this!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"64_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"64_2\">Reasons Not To Be An Idiot</td><td id=\"64_3\">This was the song most developed by the band prior to recording, and had shown up regularly in 2007 sets.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"65_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"65_2\">To Take You Home</td><td id=\"65_3\">More jingly things on a floor tom! In fact, nothing but jingly things on a floor tom! And an opportunity for me to stretch my legs at this point of the drumathon, since I can play it standing up.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"66_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"66_2\">I Knew Prufrock Before He Got Famous</td><td id=\"66_3\">One of the few songs on the album with the bass played by someone other than Frank, I brought Jase in for it. But of course. This is one of my favourites, and exemplifies my striving for \'precision that creates movement\' - details that you can play the part without, but it has a discernible but subconscious effect on how the song builds, and ebbs, and explodes.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"67_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"67_2\">Long Live The Queen</td><td id=\"67_3\">It wasn\'t long after the release that we came up with this rockin\' band version of the song, which became almost exclusively how it was played from this point forward. All those 8th notes on the snare... it\'s Rock and Roll by Led Zeppelin again!</td></tr><tr><th id=\"68_1\">5:24 pm</th><th id=\"68_2\">2008</th><th id=\"68_3\">Andy Yorke - Simple album <!--{i::8::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"69_1\">Andy Yorke</td><td id=\"69_2\">Simple</td><td id=\"69_3\">I had the great pleasure of producing and playing on Andy\'s solo record that also came out this year. In many ways it was a third UT record, since Jase played bass on much of it, but Andy was the exclusive writer. I think it\'s a beautiful record, and has a lot of perhaps surprisingly positive sentiments, exemplified well by this opening title track. I enjoyed keeping everything as simple (ha!) as possible on this album, while still achieving some distinctiveness. </td></tr><tr><td id=\"70_1\">Andy Yorke</td><td id=\"70_2\">Found The Road</td><td id=\"70_3\">Andy really does have a phenomenal voice, doesn\'t he? Could totally listen to him sing the phone book, but it doesn\'t hurt when he writes great songs like this. Love all the backing vocals at the end. Can\'t remember if that was me or him pushing for that, it\'s the kind of thing I like as a producer, but Andy always had a fondness for some of the Brian Eno albums that included this type of choral bed. </td></tr><tr><td id=\"71_1\">Andy Yorke</td><td id=\"71_2\">Twist Of The Knife</td><td id=\"71_3\">Played with brushes on the recording, so just lightly tapping the e-drums with sticks for this performance. This is one of my treasured musical memories. Jase came in to the studio, we sat down, and ran a take of this. George Shilling, old friend and engineer, was struck momentarily speechless by it - we had such a chemistry and intuition between us, it just came out instantly with an amazing atmosphere. Sometimes rocking out is fun and its own challenge, but capturing magic is the reeally hard bit of music making, so I love thinking back to the moments when I was part of a group that managed it.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"72_1\">Andy Yorke</td><td id=\"72_2\">Rise And Fall</td><td id=\"72_3\">Always thought this was a great single and should have carried the album to greater heights. The lyrical sentiment has perhaps understandably ben much on my mind of late.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"73_1\">Andy Yorke</td><td id=\"73_2\">One In A Million</td><td id=\"73_3\">At this point of the drumathon it\'s going to be a pleasure to just have songs like this to listen to. Speaks of love and optimism and joy, which was slightly new territory for Andy, but conquered confidently.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"74_1\">Andy Yorke</td><td id=\"74_2\">Mathilda</td><td id=\"74_3\">This was the one song where I felt I kept it *too* simple rhythmically. There will be a touch more dynamic to it today. #revisionistNige</td></tr><tr><td id=\"75_1\">Andy Yorke</td><td id=\"75_2\">Lay Down</td><td id=\"75_3\">Didn\'t make the album, thought I\'d take the opportunity to play it here. I got Ben Lloyd in to play some guitars.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"76_1\">Andy Yorke</td><td id=\"76_2\">Ode To A Friend</td><td id=\"76_3\">We toured the album in autumn 2008, and this was one of the songs that really came out of its shell live. It\'s 3 subtle drum parts layered up by the end, so I\'ll do the live approximation of them.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"77_1\">5:54 pm</th><th id=\"77_2\">2009</th><th id=\"77_3\">Frank Turner - Poetry Of The Deed album <!--{i::9::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"78_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"78_2\">Live Fast, Die Old</td><td id=\"78_3\">Once again sourcing these from live versions, this time from the live performance of this album at Lost Evenings in 2019. This album was the first step of us working as band, with Frank bringing in songs and all of us arranging them. Live Fast was the second I remember us getting together, and the crystallisation of the \'like Born To Run album\' aesthetic. We played it a lot on tours prior to the album - I have particular memories of it at an extraordinarily hot show at the Anson Rooms in Bristol.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"79_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"79_2\">Poetry Of The Deed</td><td id=\"79_3\">No cowbell so once again I will fill in by thrashing away at the silent rim of one of the toms.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"80_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"80_2\">Isabel</td><td id=\"80_3\">After the PotD tour we hardly ever played this arrangement of the song. It\'s fun though. Originally, and on the album as well, I had some sticks that were soft beaters at one end and standard wooden tips at the other. It involved some tricksy stick spinning while doing a drum fill with the left hand to make the change from soft beater to stick on the right hand for the chorus, but it\'s the effect of those subtleties that make it worth it.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"81_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"81_2\">Richard Devine</td><td id=\"81_3\">Apparently what I\'m playing in the middle 8 is a bembe. Someone else had to tell me that though. I was just doing something to add to the momentum at a point when it needed it. Super awesome bass playing in that section, which I think is what inspired me.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"82_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"82_2\">Sons Of Liberty</td><td id=\"82_3\">Apparently we were going for a The Levellers type feel in this, but I\'m not familiar enough with them to have known. If you look through my YouTube channel though you will see how I stole a whole bunch of Phil Collins (and a little bit of Rob Ellis) for this track.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"83_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"83_2\">Faithful Son</td><td id=\"83_3\">From time to time it\'s been said that the arrangements on this album were somehow amiss, but with evidence like this I think that\'s really not true. The mix on the record was not up to scratch and I think that was the main downer that we all felt on it, but this hangs together really brilliantly from everyone\'s contribution, and just goes to show how a really good band can lift what is already a great song.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"84_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"84_2\">Fastest Way Back Home</td><td id=\"84_3\">Ditto from above actually. This is one of those songs where I was challenging myself to see how few kick drum beats I could do during the course of a song.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"85_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"85_2\">Our Lady Of The Campfire</td><td id=\"85_3\">Spot the Ladies Of London Town? Nah, I like this one. Particularly the \'boudica boudica BO!\' backing vocals that never made the record, and we kept way off mic live.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"86_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"86_2\">Try This At Home</td><td id=\"86_3\">This was the first track we arranged from the record. It was a very early rehearsal with new recruit Matt Nasir, and it fell together in no time at all. It has survived with nary a tweak to the arrangement since then, which I think is another testament to the strength that we could achieve when all 5 of us were arranging Frank\'s material.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"87_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"87_2\">The Road</td><td id=\"87_3\">I like how the \'train\' beat keeps going on the left hand through the chorus, but man it could be a struggle, particularly when the tempos crept up. It was inspired by the peerless work of Darren Jesse from Ben Folds Five on The Last Polka (check out the performance from Sessions At West 54th on YouTube, it\'s just incredible, and SO much faster than this). There was a handful of times I got a real blind spot on this song - I would skip straight from the end of chorus one to the middle 8 and have no idea that anything was wrong until someone told me after. Managed to get out of that before too long...</td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n\r\n79 songs later, and hopefully here we are at dinner time for me, and a 20 or 25 minute break.

Overshadowed by the mainstream commerciality of what 3/4 of the band were contributing to, but when I look back, when I\'m grey and old, I\'ll provide this as evidence that my life perhaps wasn\'t an entire waste of time. Here\'s more wilful simplicity - it doesn\'t matter whether what I\'m doing is simple or complicated, quirky or straight, it just has to sound like I\'ve CHOSEN to do exactly that, and to play the song any other way could work, but it wouldn\'t be right.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"3_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"3_2\">Alarum</td><td id=\"3_3\">A bit of a magpie here - anyone familiar with the first PJ Harvey album may recognise the drum beat to Dress (the 3 snares across 4 kicks, with the momentum from the foot closed hi hat with tambourine on the off beats). I perhaps try and explore the idea in other ways than the original. Does that let me off straight up nicking it?</td></tr><tr><td id=\"4_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"4_2\">Damage Control</td><td id=\"4_3\">On the record and live I used to play a metal teacup that someone had given me as a Christmas present once. It couldn\'t stand up to the punishment sadly, and broke, so I\'m using a wee little cowbell I\'ve had since I was 15 instead. I enjoy the challenge to my feet in this song.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"5_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"5_2\">Liar</td><td id=\"5_3\">This is a complex bit of drum beatery, all inspired by Jamie\'s fabulous guitar riff. It always made me feel like I was going to get my arms tied in knots. Self-imposed rules to challenge myself for this song - no keeping time on the hi hat or the ride, but still make it rock.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"6_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"6_2\">The You In Me</td><td id=\"6_3\">Yannis from Foals was a big fan of Dive Dive back in the day. This is us trying to sound like Foals. One of the things I liked about Genesis is that some of their best and most original songs sounded like them trying to sound like someone else, but utterly failing (Mama: \"we\'re Grandmaster Flash And The Furious 5!\"; Squonk: \"we\'re Led Zeppelin\"; That\'s All: \"we\'re Dolly Parton\". Really lads, you\'re not) and this falls into that category for me.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"7_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"7_2\">Wherewithal</td><td id=\"7_3\">And on that future death bed of oxygen-sucking justification, I will hold up this song particularly. I liken it to Supper\'s Ready (lot of Genesis action in this blog) - it doesn\'t follow any normal rules of song structure / length, but is so well formed it doesn\'t sound like it could ever be any other way. The elastic timing is a great example of what made us a great band.<!--{f::1::n}--></td></tr><tr><td id=\"8_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"8_2\">Ape Like Me</td><td id=\"8_3\">Self-imposed rules to challenge myself for this song - how simple can I keep it while still keeping the dynamics and power intact? Spoiler alert for this one if you haven\'t seen the original Planet Of The Apes</td></tr><tr><td id=\"9_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"9_2\">Collapse From The Hurt</td><td id=\"9_3\">While I\'m intending to do a fair amount of the backing vocals that I did on records in the Drumathon, this is one where I will happily leave them out. The end of this song is some energetic drumming overlaid with a relentless backing vocal that doesn\'t allow much room for drawing breath. Doing it live, I nearly blacked out on more than one occassion.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"10_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"10_2\">The Point Is</td><td id=\"10_3\">Rare technology addition for DD - I had a loop pedal that I would play a clatter of drumming into as a bed for this track, and that\'s what you can hear at the start and various other points in the song. Played in live, turned on and off by my foot at the appropriate moments.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"11_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"11_2\">You Call Is Important To Us</td><td id=\"11_3\">I love the precision that creates movement, but sometimes a song demands improvisational energy. It has to be the same level of thought out choice to do that, but this is on one of those tracks, which is why I sound like a particularly jittery Stuart Copeland in the verses. And what the actual fuck is going on with that one bar of 7 in the middle 8 that moves the guitars from on to off the beat? I think it was my idea, and it\'s a cool, disquieting trick, but holy boy does it require some concentration to pull off. For me at least. I\'m sure Benny Greb / Camille Bigeault wouldn\'t even bat an eyelid.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"12_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"12_2\">Pod People</td><td id=\"12_3\">K. I. S. S. The acronym, not the band.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"13_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"13_2\">Indifference</td><td id=\"13_3\">Left off the album, but pretty fucking great if you ask me. Like the Bo Diddly style verse drumming, and the fab vocoder in the second verse.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"14_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"14_2\">Let\'s Swap Places</td><td id=\"14_3\">I mixed this song. It\'s a pretty literal mix. If that is a thing.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td id=\"15_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"15_2\">Potential</td><td id=\"15_3\">Typical DD perversity, the album title track is 45 seconds, hidden at the end and features tuned milk bottles.</td></tr><tr><th id=\"16_1\">7.29 pm</th><th id=\"16_2\">2011</th><th id=\"16_3\">Frank Turner - England Keep My Bones album <!--{i::2::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"17_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"17_2\">Peggy Sang The Blues</td><td id=\"17_3\">This was the beginning of what I consider to be the 3 album run that was our creative and commercial apogee, With all 5 members arranging songs in a way that brought the very best out of them. Here\'s a case in point - the bass line here is central to the feel and distinctiveness of the recording. Once again no separate tracks, so these versions are from the 2014 O2 Arena show.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"18_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"18_2\">Glory Hallelujah</td><td id=\"18_3\">Someone (an American) once described my drumming on this as \'pocket playing\', as in finding and nailing the groove. If they are correct, then I\'m happy. There\'s a little drum break at the end involving the ride cymbal I find pretty sexy. Hopefully I can remember and play it correctly at this stage of the Drumathon.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"19_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"19_2\">Wessex Boy</td><td id=\"19_3\">Another chance for a quick stretch of the legs - a drum part I can play standing up! Similar stuff - jingly stuff resting on a floor tom.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"20_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"20_2\">If Ever I Stray</td><td id=\"20_3\">I always had trouble controlling the speed going into the chorus of this - excitement got me going too fast. That is most assuredly the case here. Not often I was a victim of adrenaline (due to my general dourness). But there was something special about this band, both recorded and live. We did a couple of paternity leave tours, one with a different keyboardist and one with a different bass player. They were both very good musicians, and playing all the right notes, but it was obviously not quite as good. The first 95% of being a good band isn\'t too hard, in a way - practicing and rehearsing and focusing. It\'s the last, elusive, magical 5% that sets bands apart, and something in the chemistry the 5 of us had pushed us up a fair few of those difficult last points. Taking any part of that out took it from \'breathtaking\' to merely very good. </td></tr><tr><td id=\"21_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"21_2\">I Still Believe</td><td id=\"21_3\">A band working at full pelt - Matt\'s piano driving the chorus with a catchy riff that is part of most people\'s mental perception of the song, whether they realise it or not, a great bassline that I love playing around (there\'s a bit in the second verse where the bass and kick drum are deliberately working around each other that is HOT), and Ben making sure the whole thing never sounds like a bunch of tedious session playing hired guns just arriving for one record with no skin in the game. Put that with a catchy and well-written song, and you have a winner!</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"22_1\">7.47 pm</th><th id=\"22_2\">2013</th><th id=\"22_3\">Aurora J.

Young</td><td id=\"23_2\">Local Hero</td><td id=\"23_3\">In the midst of the busiest couple of years of recording and touring ever, I managed to squeeze in making this album, via George Shilling. The budget was small so I took the efficient approach - I did drum demos of the songs Aurora and George were sending me in the rehearsal room, discussing and doing revisions as needed, so when it came time to record I could hammer through them in a day and a half. I don\'t know why, but I still listen to this record with some pride. It\'s the most pop thing that I\'ve done, it\'s eloquently produced by Mr Shilling, and the songs are strong. What\'s not to like? I was desperately trying to be like Ash Soan for most of this... </td></tr><tr><td id=\"24_1\">Aurora J. Young</td><td id=\"24_2\">Guilty Pleasure</td><td id=\"24_3\">But as much as I try to be like Ash Soan or any other drummer much better than I, it still sounds like me. I like to try and twist things just enough to give them personality. I think that applies to this song.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"25_1\">Aurora J. Young</td><td id=\"25_2\">Reap What You Sow</td><td id=\"25_3\">As it happened around this time, and for the first time in my life, my drumming esteem was at a low ebb. I had gotten out of the habit of thinking that people appreciated what I did. That\'s why I had to come back in a day after I finished (I remember getting the call while in a supermarket in Burton-On-Trent with my partner at the time, who I really didn\'t get to see much) to have another crack at the end of this song. I had underplayed it, listening to the critical voices in my head saying \"oh shut it nige\", but Aurora liked the feel of the demo where I\'d been a bit freer. A quick hour session and I had given it a bit more of a bombastic, drum break filled ending, and everyone seemed happy. (Except my partner).</td></tr><tr><td id=\"26_1\">Aurora J. Young</td><td id=\"26_2\">One Last Night</td><td id=\"26_3\">More brushes that I don\'t have on the e-kit.

Young</td><td id=\"29_2\">Passing Me By</td><td id=\"29_3\">I remember I got George to set up the delay on the snare in the studio so I could play off it. This also has a trick that I seem to do often - playing a drum phrase that kind of mirrors what it seems the vocal might do, and sometimes the vocal actually doesn\'t. First is deliberately punctuating the end of the phrase \"waiting for\", and then repeating it on the next measure even though the vocals move elsewhere. And at the end of the chorus I play as if the phrase \"passing me by\" is going to be sung straight and rigid, which I think reinforces the expressiveness of how it is actually sung. There\'s some insight into my head!</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"30_1\">8.14 pm</th><th id=\"30_2\">2013</th><th id=\"30_3\">Frank Turner - Tape Deck Heart album <!--{i::4::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"31_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"31_2\">Recovery</td><td id=\"31_3\">This is the album, and indeed the single, that was our pinnacle of commercial success, even though I don\'t think it was our creative or artistic high point (that for me would be one of the albums on either side). I think its success was down to it being one of the two the most effectively \'band\' records we made - the 5 of us arranging Frank\'s songs was a potent combination. This song is a case in point - while Rich Costey\'s production brought it into focus, I have demos of this showing that as a 5 piece we already had the feel and the parts nailed. I think that makes it easier for a producer - instead of using your skills just to bring something up to being good, when presented with something already great you can tweak it to an even higher level.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"32_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"32_2\">The Way I Tend To Be</td><td id=\"32_3\">An interesting case - our original arrangement was much subtler, prettier and less stomping and obvious. It was on the cusp of being dropped in the studio when, with a sigh, I said ok, let me go back in and try something else, and attacked it with this more Bonham-y approach, which immediately enthused everyone and got it back on track. I\'m not a great fan of it myself - I loved the chords and the sentiment of the song, and giving it the moronic \"please play me on the radio\" approach (even though as usual I tried to find ways to make the part just unusual enough in subtle ways) was antithetical to my idea of art. I suppose it was part of me accepting that this outfit was not really about art, but about success, which I suppose is ok.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"33_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"33_2\">Plain Sailing Weather</td><td id=\"33_3\">Despite the swearing, the record company at one point was suggesting this as the lead-off single for the album campaign. I don\'t think that\'s a terrible idea. I spent a tour trying to get my double kick chops up to a level where I could do the end section rhythm on kick rather than snare, but I never managed. And fucked my knee up in the process!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"34_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"34_2\">Four Simple Words</td><td id=\"34_3\">While all of the tracks were arranged over a long period on the road, I think this was the first song we had working for this record. We certainly had played it in live a great deal beforehand. I think the recorded version suffers a little from being played to a metronome in the middle section, but it\'s nae too bad.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"35_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"35_2\">Polaroid Picture</td><td id=\"35_3\">More percussion type hitting things I can\'t recreate on an e-kit, this time hitting the rim of my snare drum with a maraca. </td></tr><tr><th id=\"36_1\">8.34 pm</th><th id=\"36_2\">2015</th><th id=\"36_3\">The Sad Song Co. - in amber album <!--{i::5::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"37_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"37_2\">Touch Of Us</td><td id=\"37_3\">My first solo album in a long time, partially due to the ridiculous tour schedule I\'d been on, partially because I hadn\'t felt in the right place with it creatively. My partner at the time encouraged me on hearing me fiddling about with ideas, and from that came in amber. I originally tried to fire myself as singer and get someone else, but in the end it didn\'t sound quite right without me singing. Awesome huge drumsound from my engineer friend Graeme Stewart, rattling around my concert toms with aplomb</td></tr><tr><td id=\"38_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"38_2\">Last Dance Of The Evening</td><td id=\"38_3\">Starts in 7/8, shifts to 6/8 for the end section, all played with brushes (so it won\'t sound quite the same today). For a solo album by a drummer theres a surprising amount of songs without much drumming on. This one is fun though - I like trying to find grooves for odd time signatures such that they don\'t really sound odd. Great bass playing by Jase, of course.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"39_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"39_2\">Beautifully Possessed</td><td id=\"39_3\">The drums were actually recorded during sessions for Poignant Device, but I never got around to finishing the song until 2014. Beaters, snare turned off, I like trying to find ways of playing the drums that contribute the maximum personality to the song.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"40_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"40_2\">Legacy Of Love</td><td id=\"40_3\">The name \'The Sad Song Co.\' was always supposed to be both a serious descriptive (it\'s not generally uptempo dance numbers) but also slightly tongue in cheek, since I do write some songs with positive sentiments. The previous two, while perhaps tinged with sadness, are love songs, and this is an ode to understanding and togetherness that I wanted to sound like Elbow (it didn\'t). More excellent bass work from Jase, I love his chordal and melodic lines. He really doesn\'t write basslines like anyone else.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"41_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"41_2\">The Ones Who Heal</td><td id=\"41_3\">It\'s a Purdie / Fool In The Rain halftime shuffle, except played over 3/4 instead of 4/4. Honestly, on the album it\'s a bit fussy and overplayed. Maybe I can pare it down a bit here. </td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"42_1\">8.55 pm</th><th id=\"42_2\">2015</th><th id=\"42_3\">Frank Turner - Positive Songs For Negative People album <!--{i::6::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"43_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"43_2\">Get Better</td><td id=\"43_3\">A real good album to make, coming off a lot of relentless touring for TDH, a band at the top of our game. Recorded the whole thing in less than 2 weeks, as opposed to the 3 months of the previous record. I often think of this song as a good example of my part creation philosophy - sounds, and indeed is for the most part, very straightforward, but there\'s enough details (the snare / Sabian 10\" Chopper [snigger] at the beginning, the 6 beat phrase on the foot closed hi hat in verse one that moves to the kick for verse 2) to give it a personality that would be subconsciously missing were they to be removed.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"44_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"44_2\">The Next Storm</td><td id=\"44_3\">An excellent example of our strength as a band - we had a version of this but Tarrant pushed to do something more with the song. In a soundcheck he suggested the fast swing feel, I started playing this drumbeat, Matt immediately jumped in with an excellently propulsive piano part, and Ben made the chorus sing with his guitar line. There\'s some little bits with a tambourine and the chopper (snigger) that can\'t be done on an e-kit here.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"45_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"45_2\">Love 40 Down</td><td id=\"45_3\">I appreciate the way this song builds up. Every kick drum beat is a conscious choice.</td></tr><tr><th id=\"46_1\">9.03 pm</th><th id=\"46_2\">2018</th><th id=\"46_3\">Frank Turner - Be More Kind album <!--{i::7::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"47_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"47_2\">Blackout</td><td id=\"47_3\">So as not to get stale, this album was approached differently, for the most part (exceptions noted below). For example, this song was demoed by Frank with producers Josh Block and Austin Jenkins, with me ultimately following what Josh (who is an excellent drummer) had played, with the occasional detail tweak. For a lot of the album I hung close to what Frank had on his demos, apart from the songs noted below, and Common Ground, which I programmed and played from the ground up.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"48_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"48_2\">Little Changes</td><td id=\"48_3\">While a lot of the album was dictated by Frank\'s solo demos, this is an unusual case - over our whole career - of us as a band ignoring the demo entirely. I think collectively the feel the song should have was blatant from the word go, so we just played it like that, and didn\'t even try the slightly moribund mid-tempo indie of the demo version. It\'s fun! Did tom tom overdubs on this, which made doing it live with only one pair of hands a bit tricky, especially while singing.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"49_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"49_2\">21st Century Survival Blues</td><td id=\"49_3\">Tarrant had an alarming conversation with someone on a plane in Australia that we all overheard, and the lyrics of this song relay parts of it, some verbatim. This is very like Frank\'s demo with added fills and feel, except the middle 8 which we figured out with Josh in the studio.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"50_1\">Frank Turner and the Sleeping Souls</td><td id=\"50_2\">1933</td><td id=\"50_3\">The other song on the album arranged entirely by the band. We had recorded a version of it in our first session for the album, but it was lacking, so on the live dates that fell in between our two sets of recording dates we put our heads together in soundchecks to make it work. I particularly remember it really coming together during the afternoon in the open air in Salt Lake City when we were opening for Jason Isbell And The 400 Unit.</td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><th id=\"51_1\">9.18 pm</th><th id=\"51_2\">2018</th><th id=\"51_3\">The Sad Song Co. - Worth album <!--{i::8::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"52_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"52_2\">I Don\'t See It</td><td id=\"52_3\">Once again, a drummer\'s solo album with not all that much drumming on it. If I\'d done all of this record there would have been a whole lot of just sitting around twiddling my thumbs. Which, 11 hours in, may have been welcome, but definitely not in the spirit of the event. Even this song doesn\'t actually have any real drums until a few minutes in, but I\'ll flail about and pretend I\'m a drum machine.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"53_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"53_2\">Lonely Is A State Of Mind</td><td id=\"53_3\">This is drawing from the 80s Phil Collins well, rather than the 70s version - simple, driving and straight ahead. I even steal a drum break or two from his exemplary playing on Do They Know It\'s Christmas? The lovely Chris T-T co-wrote the lyrics to this when I just couldn\'t get it finished. Again, it might be the sad song co., but this one is all about the thrill I had of meeting someone in Oslo and falling in love, and how that can be a profound life change.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"54_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"54_2\">Worth My Bones</td><td id=\"54_3\">Warning you now, I\'m going to fuck this one up a bit. Unusually based around a drum part - I had the 5/8 beat in the verses in this song for ages, and eventually wrote a piano part to go along with it. In the choruses the feel trips me up sometimes, hence my warning. I haven\'t played any of these songs since recording them, naturally, so they haven\'t had the chance to become ingrained like the tracks I played live often with other people. I took the drums off for this version, but at some point Billy The Kid\'s co-lead vocal disappeared, which is why it is absent. Sorry Billy!</td></tr><tr><th id=\"55_1\">9.30 pm</th><th id=\"55_2\">2019</th><th id=\"55_3\">Dive Dive - The Waves Behind album <!--{i::9::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"56_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"56_2\">Lion Weight</td><td id=\"56_3\">This album had a more difficult gestation. We recorded the bulk it at least a couple of years before it finally got released, but various things got in the way of finishing it off. Despite some ambivalence on my part, I didn\'t want it to languish so eventually I pushed through getting it done, mixed and released. It\'s strong work again. Jamie is one talented so and so, a fabulously refreshing original thinker, both musically and lyrically. The title was my pun I think. I only put it in as a working title joke, but it seems we kept it.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"57_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"57_2\">Old Man</td><td id=\"57_3\">It\'s fun working with someone like Jamie - his playing and ideas are so original it often inspires me to supportive simplicity, since it\'s already distinctive. Note - the middle 8 of this is fearsome fast, and at this point of proceedings might cause ill effects.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"58_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"58_2\">There\'s A Knack To It</td><td id=\"58_3\">Poptastic! Rattly jingles on the floor tom! Backing vocals!</td></tr><tr><td id=\"59_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"59_2\">Sludge</td><td id=\"59_3\">A song that dated from 2007, with another new bit dropped in as a verse. Jamie and I used to write the basis of the DD songs by playing at each other in the rehearsal room, and this was a bit we had with no home. I suggested marrying them up, and viola! Or cello.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"60_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"60_2\">Dishonest Contest</td><td id=\"60_3\">Working title Pixies, with good reason I think. One of my reasons for choosing to do these songs for Drumathon is I know throughout there will be things I look forward to playing, just because I want to hear them. This is one of the many examples of that.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"61_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"61_2\">Common Cold</td><td id=\"61_3\">Standard drumbeat with an extra kickdrum beat added to just make it slightly odd. What is \'scratching elevens\'? Anyone know? Throwing right back to very nearly the start, the end of this song is a (very prominent) backing vocal that really is almost too high for me, especially while I\'m expending large amounts of oxygen keeping the drums going.</td></tr><tr><td id=\"62_1\">Dive Dive</td><td id=\"62_2\">Better Off</td><td id=\"62_3\"></td></tr><tr><th id=\"63_1\">9.50 pm</th><th id=\"63_2\">2021</th><th id=\"63_3\">The Sad Song Co. - Saudade album <!--{i::10::c}--></th></tr><tr><td id=\"64_1\">The Sad Song Co.</td><td id=\"64_2\">Hastings, Out Of Season</td><td id=\"64_3\">The final chronological stretch!

It\'s going to be interesting!',53),(86,'<!--{i::1::c}-->\r\nHaving talked in the abstract in the previous Orphans blog about the process of writing, and the bits I brought together to get to a finished song, I thought it might be interesting, to one or two people perhaps, to actually post audio snippets of the raw materials for another song. This is an outtake from my latest album Saudade.\r\nAs I\'ve mentioned in a few interviews this album came about when I was writing over christmas 2020 for a putative Sleeping Souls project. Part of writing for me always involves going through my stockpile of raw materials. If I\'m puttering away on the piano or guitar and something interesting comes out I\'ll grab my phone and record it into the voice memos<!--{f::1::n}-->. I\'ll say in advance, these are never intended for public consumption, so are full of mistakes and clams and hesitations and vagaries.\r\nOne that caught my ear was called SatisfyingCmaj7.<!--{f::2::n}-->\r\n<!--{a::1::n}-->\r\nI don\'t have any memory of when I put this in my phone, but my instinct is it was quite a while ago, while I was with my partner in Oslo. What tends to happen is I\'ll be sat at a piano improvising random chords, and something will catch my ear that I\'ll then try and mould into a moment, and then record. And often after that I\'ll continue fiddling and another section presents itself, inspired by the first. This was the case here, since next to it in my folder of ideas was Satisfying Verseriff.\r\n<!--{a::2::n}-->\r\nI included the original Satisfying Cmaj7 part (with some exciting new wrong notes!) so I could show how I was getting from one part to the other and how it worked.\r\nWith these two bits, I had to figure out how to approach them. How I decided to come at it was driven by two factors, one creative, one practical.\r\na) I always want to push myself to at least try and find something distinctive, and in this case that meant trying to get away from the Ben Folds / Elton John piano chords and someone singing paradigm.\r\nb) Trying to get a strong melody is always my biggest headache.\r\nThese two bits already had melodies I reacted to in the parts, so I extracted those, and then tried some simple backing parts, and a slightly loping, almost latin rhythm (inspired by the peerless work of drummer Benny Greb). More on this in a mo...\r\nOnce I\'d got it somewhat working as an arrangement, it was needing some kind of musical hook to lead into the vocals. I remembered a tiny idea that had been in the folder for years without a home, because it sounded a bit too Scooby Doo.\r\n<!--{a::3::n}-->\r\nThe initial version had it on a guitar (with the idea that Ben would make it sound awesome), but when it became a Sad Song Co. album I moved it to a slightly off kilter synth sound I\'d programmed.\r\nIn the initial demoing sessions as I was simplifying the backing I challenged myself to simplify it completely. The piano chords were so pretty I thought it might work just having them recreated by vocals over the rhythm. I figured out all the harmonies, layered them up, and added back in some tiny bits of chordal accompaniment where they seemed needed. I wrote the lyrics mostly on the spot, trying to find a positive way to express how caustic loneliness is, and encourage communication and reaching out.\r\nBy this point though it was only a verse - chorus - verse - chorus, and it ran into the buffers without any kind of conclusion. Since the lyrics were pretty upbeat, I thought it would be suitable to have an upbeat ending, so I took all the bits I had, threw them up into the air and caught them in a bag called \'Motown\'. Normally when I\'m creating things I try and pare them down to their minimal bones, but in this case I threw many kitchen sinks into it, even recruiting a friend of a friend to do some remote lockdown trumpet - his brief was \"like a Mexican street party\".\r\nSo after all that, here is what it sounded like. Let me know what you think in the comments!\r\n<!--{a::4::n}-->',54),(87,'I\'ve written my very first poem.<!--{f::1::n}--> Could be my last as well, who knows.

This is the only thing I\'ve done that just stands alone, as words.
